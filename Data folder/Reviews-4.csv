The price that Amazon charges is HALF of what I pay at my local pet store if I have to buy them there. The ingredients are pure, natural, and healthy. The jerky is not dried out and brittle; it is moist and chewy. No carbohydrates to make your pet gain weight either. My cats even like these (I break them into small pieces for them). The beef ones almost smell like they have a little bacon in them (but they don't). My dogs come running the minute they hear the rustle of this bag when I pick it up. I know many dog trainers that swear by these too. These will get your dog to do ANYTHING! I highly recommend these!"

Recieved in perfect condition - it was well bubble wrapped. Shipping is more than the tea but hey for under $14 I have over a pound of tea. That is less than 6 cents a cup, half the price of the same in bag form even with free super saver shipping. That's only a bargain if the tea is good, and it is in my opinion. The Ceylon green tea is not grassy like many greens. The large broken pieces of leaf have a full and pleasant taste. Not bitter. The tea flavor definitely comes through in the blend. The bergamot smells wonderfully of citrus and tastes just as good. The bergamot is not overdone but isn't underdone either. Similar to the level of bergamot in Twinings but slightly less bright.

I am a huge miso soup fan, but not overly picky. If it is miso I'm usually happy with it.

I don't know if it is the lack of a dashi stock due to it being vegetarian but the soup itself is very bland. All of the flavor seems to come from the overpowering onion and, surprisingly, the tofu cubes. The tofu cubes are extremely salty and it is odd to eat such a bland soup and then *POW* get hit in the face with salty tofu. I would expect the stock to be salty and the tofu to be bland.

Campbells also added flaps on each side of the bag (where it is natural to grab while getting it out of the microwave) that make it so you don't burn your fingers.

I like curry so if this worked out yay me! Well Yay Me! This was RIDICULOUSLY good. While it was heating in the microwave (as it said to do in the directions) the fragrant aromas started seeping out. I was shocked. This smelled almost exactly like when I make coconut curry sauce on my own. It smelled so fresh and authentic, the only thing left to doubt was the taste. Surely the aroma was just some canned, chemically manufactured olfactory trick. I was happily proven wrong. The taste and the smell all fit together. And unlike Campbell's canned soups, where you had small pieces of of mushy vegetables or meat, here you had big pieces of carrots and chicken and crunchy water chestnuts, the shittake mushrooms were small however, but not negligible.<br /><br />Seriously try it out for yourself.

566727,B000634EZS,A3U4GWFXO18FCZ,"Cynthia Baker ""pseudo intellectual""",23,24,4,1103328000,Smells WONDERFUL,"I had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the Pet Expo in Del Mar, CA and had noticed how wonderful it smells. The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.<br /><br />I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any ""dust"" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.<br /><br />As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily ""stirring"", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.<br /><br />The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don't dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says ""CHEMICAL FREE..."" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read ""HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE"" or ""BIOTOXIN FREE"".<br /><br />Anyway, I'll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I've tried a premium litter, I'll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best."

My cat used to use the compressed, recycled newsprint litter (like Carefresh or Yesterday's News) and I thought that was good, but then I read about Feline Pine and decided to give it a try. Well, there is simply NO SMELL AT ALL. I live in a small studio apartment which I thought was forever fated to smell like a litterbox, but with the discovery of Feline Pine, which absorbs all of the ammonia  odor, you don't even know I have a cat unless you see her. The tracking is noticably reduced and there is much less mess. I highly recommend you try this stuff - my cat made the switch with no problem at all, and it's been completely worth it for both of us (my apartment doesn't stink, and she doesn't inhale clay dust.)"

The pellets were little strange for me to get used to, but I was willing to do anything to keep the mean lady happy.  Then, I couldn't believe my whiskers.  There was no smell for weeks.

However, we had some usage in the first and once we converted the second to fp they seemed to be perfectly happy. Results have been great! there is more odor immediately after the cat goes #2 but there is literally no on-going odor and the cats don't smell like chemicals after using the litter box. Much better for us and them. In addition, there is far less tracking (we use the non-clumping fp). Once the cat urine has broken the pellets into sawdust you can see some tracking of the sawdust but that is an easy indicator it is time to do some cleaning! Definitely need to have the right equipment (sifting cat litter box and the right scooper). Very happy customer."

I need heat and the only products that give me any detectable heat, are specialty sauces like Dave's insanity or ghost pepper sauce.  I had bought the Insanity in the past and was looking for it when I found a discounted price on the ghost pepper.  For the past 10 days I have been using it on everything.  I supplement bbq sauces with it, blend it with salsas, even mix it with yellow mustard on egg, sausage, and cheese bagels.  My tolerance is growing.  I went from a dab to about 1/2 tsp already.  This allows me to enjoy the smoky, sweet flavor (at first all you feel is the heat).  I don't think that this is as hot as Insanity but it's been awhile and the internet searches all say that the ghost pepper is much hotter.  Maybe I am just advancing along my heat journey, but this doesn't seem to burn my skin/lips/mucous membrane as much as insanity sauce did.  I will be stocking up on more bottles of this sauce.  I put it on a drop at a time and then spread it with a knife.  I have found that it works best with a medium like BBQ, salsa, mustard.  You should put those on first since they are the vehicle to allow this to be spread evenly.  Otherwise the bread, tortilla, etc just soaks up the drops and you have uneven distribution."

This hot sauce is hot but not unbearable. It is flavorful and goes well in many of our dishes. I put some on our holiday turkey and was impressed by the way it interacts. Now, for those that think you have to splash hot sauce on everything, you really are just wasting product. A spread over a wide surface with just enough sauce to colorize the surface is perfect. We are comparing this sauce to the Dave's Insanity sauce which is slightly less heat at the beginning but Insanity burns longer with more intensity than this one does. This one trails off after a few minutes but doesnt have the intensity at the beginning.

If they touch it and then touch their mouth or eyes, they'll panic and remember it.  I eat habanero hot sauce every day- no exageration, no lie.  My wife and I love hot food and can handle it hotter than most.  This stuff, however, is just ridiculous.  It really should come with a big, bold warning rather than being nestled unassumingly among the other hot sauces.  The taste is good but you can't have enough of it on anything to enjoy it.  All of the other hot sauces in the fridge get empty and replaced while Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce sits untouched week after week.  In my opinion, this isn't a food; it's a repellant like mace."

If this sauce is too hot for you have some cold milk on standby, don't use water or soda to cool you down because it just makes the burn worse.

I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno, habanero, cayenne, and other ordinary peppers. I'm no expert and would never claim to be, just to be clear. My initial impression of this sauce was ""yuck"" because it was so bitter and metallic and unpleasant to me. It is hot, yes, but not OMG-I'm-dying hot.

This was actually the second one from package and I love it. Third one was ""West African VooDoo Juice"" that actually comes with handmade voodoo doll :), but besides that makes a great and original addition to your food and therefore deserves recommendation.

I was unimpressed with their habanero ""hot"" salsa. Eager to kick it up a notch, I reached for a bottle of what I later found to be Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper Jolokia Hot Sauce. I unscrewed the top and went to put a dab on. I quickly realized that there was no flow regulation but not before a large pool of the magma colored liquid dripped into my lunch. I decided to dab my finger in it and see what I was dealing with. It was formidable, sweet and flavorful with a long heat. I thought I could take the heat.<br /><br />I demolished the burrito, hot sauce and all, and shrugged off the pain. Every bite was saturated with the taste of a thousand tortured souls but the guacamole still tasted great. I wiped my tingling lips and while downing a glass of water I looked at the bottle. It claimed a heat rating of ""Insanity++."" I headed home thinking surely the worst must be over. I've ate plenty of hot food and my stomach is battle tested. I was wrong.<br /><br />I walked no more than a block before I started to feel odd. It was in the forties in Cleveland but I could feel the sweat forming on my brow. I walked another block and I could literally feel the burning sensation outlining my stomach. My breaths were noticeably faster and shorter. People on the street looked at me weird. I figured it would go away by the time I got home but I decided to pick up the pace. By the time my apartment was in sight I was experiencing tunnel vision and it felt like a live agitated weasel had been placed inside me. I knew what I had to do. After flushing my lunch, a tablespoon of this sauce, half a gallon of milk, and my ego down the drain, I can honestly say I am just happy to be alive. This sauce is not for mortals."

Initially, it was hot but certainly no hotter than other sauces I've had.  I quickly followed up with another dime sized dab on a chip.  Shortly thereafter, it began to feel as if my tongue was being electrocuted.  My eyes began to sting and my lips went numb.  The ecstasy brought about by eating spicy food poured up out of my mouth and into my head.  I laid down and the dog started to act very worried.  While prostrate, I focused on the pain and stared into the darkness of my own eyelids.  Every little thing becomes significant when the mind is seeking relief from pain.  I do not know what will happen when this stuff makes its way through my digestive tract.  I'll be eating more soon."
566782,B001PQTYN2,A17HMM1M7T9PJ1,Timothy B. Riley,32,34,4,1234742400,The Hottest of the Hot (for now),"It seems like there is a new ""Hottest Pepper in the World"" every couple of years or so.  Not too long ago it was the Red Savina® Habanero with a Scoville heat rating of 577,000 units.  Now it is the Naga Jolokia (also known as the Naga Morris, Nai Miris, Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia, etc.) with a whopping 1,001,304  Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute. In February 2007, Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia) as the hottest pepper in the world.  It is reportedly called the ""Ghost Pepper"" because after one bite of the pepper you ""give up the ghost"".<br /><br />Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper.  This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain.  So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)?  I for one like the taste.  It is a little smokier that Habanero.  I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce.  Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.<br /><br />My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals).  I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive.  It's low on flavor but big on heat.  Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think.  Dave also has a special edition sauce that uses the Bhut Jolokia pepper and cost about four times more than this one does.  I like this sauce, but use with caution."

After receiving this industrial solvent in the mail, I called some buddies over for burritos, beer and baseball.<br /><br />Cut to fifteen minutes later: four men are sitting around, watching baseball and drinking beer as it dawns on them that there is an angry dragon writhing about in each of their stomachs.  The dragons breathe white hot fire that scorches their mouths and ravages their tongues.  Ever men, they remain erect and try to soothe the dragon's temper with gifts of alcohol. Quickly, though, the supply dwindles and furtive glances dart around the room.  Who will break first?  As sweat drips down their foreheads and stings their eyes, they try to think about baseball...think about baseball...think about baseball...and then one makes a break for it!  In an instant there is a stampede for the kitchen.  They fling open the refrigerator and, snorting like wild bulls, rip open another case and chug like Dionysus reborn--but to no avail.<br /><br />This alcohol is fueling the fire and not dousing it.  With choked and gasping breath one whispers ""milk"".  Upending the kitchen they can find none of the sweet elixir.  With tears streaming down their faces they tear outside, but in the rush of flailing limbs they fall into a heap on the pavement.  ""Oh no"" they say, realizing the horrible truth.  In their haste to quench this insatiable heat they made a fatal mistake: they are way too drunk to drive.  Rising from the ground, they take off on foot for the nearest corner store.  Soon, none can bear to breathe through their mouths; the dragon's flames lick at their lips unbearably.  As they breathe heavily through their noses, their sinuses are soon aflame from the intense heat and begin their own form of self defense.<br /><br />What a spectacle!  Four grown men with red faces, streaming eyes and snot flying into the wind as they gasp and wheeze down the road, driven by the fires of hell itself.<br /><br />Soon, the fat one falls, hitting the ground hard but stretching his hands out for help.  Through the sneezing and wheezing no words can escape his ruined lips.  Onward the three friends push with nary a backward glance.  ""We will remember you fondly, fat one"" they say to themselves, hearts roasted free of compassion.<br /><br />They burst into the corner store as one drunken, moaning entity of pure thirst and claw their way to the milk.  With wild abandon, they forego such modern niceties as payment and immediately pour gallons of soothing white mana into their gaping, flaming maws.  They sink to the floor in the silent thanks of men spared the gallows.  One thought lingers in their minds: ""that guac sure was tasty."""

Standard shape, somewhat mundane label, but it contained a substance that had a curiously bright crimson and orange color. Once opened it had a spicy smell, not unlike Tobasco although thankfully without the overwhelmingly foul essence of vinegar.<br /><br />Well, time for a taste. I got a good thick coat of the bright substance on my index finger and took the plunge. It had a pretty nice tangy flavor... That is it had a nice flavor for about 1500 milliseconds before Oppenheimer hit the red button and, ""I am become heat, the destroyer of digestive tracts.""<br /><br />The heat hit me like a runaway freight train hitting a house of cards. No, make that a run away freight train with several JATOs attached to the rear propelling it somewhere above the upper class neighborhood of mach 2. I doubled over and let out a raspy gasp, my face flushed to a hue not unlike the sauce itself, my eyes became a water park. My aural senses became dull like I was at the bottom of a swimming pool.<br /><br />I heard a knock at the door and stumbled towards it with blurred vision. It was a county sheriff at the door and he was there to serve me. My own tongue, esophagus, uvula, stomach, and intestinal tract had somehow just filed a class action lawsuit against me. I reeled backwards and fell onto the couch and tried to focus my bleary eyes on a small fuzzy object on the floor. It was my cat, standing quietly and observing my plight. Maybe it was the impaired vision, maybe it was the start of something more spiritual, but my cat's face warped into a Cheshire smile many times the girth of his face. Each tooth glowing with the luster of tarnished gold in an unholy candlelight. His eyes sank back into ashen voids, glimmering ember pin points at the center of each gaping socket. The room around him began to dance and spin and the walls eventually melted away to reveal a brimstone canyon stretching as far as could be imagined. ""Soooo hoooot it's spoooooky,"" my cat boomed, his voice echoed with a baritone bass that would surely send James Earl Jones running for the hills. Sweating, hyperventilating, and nearly blind, my vision finally faded to black.<br /><br />I awoke with blinding light bombarding my face. How long was I out? Slowly gyrating figures came into focus and as my eyes adjusted more I recognized them as people standing over me. A few more moments and I was able to see one of the faces and... Grandpa?!<br /><br />I bolted upright nearly headbutting the entire crowd looming over me ""Am I dead?!"" I shouted.<br /><br />""No, no. You just had a bit too much of the insanity sauce in one go, I'm afraid. You'll be back to the mortal world in a few moments,"" my grandpa stated non nonchalantly, adjusting his tie slightly.<br /><br />""So, wait,"" I began, ""Wha... what is this? ...Is this?""<br /><br />""Maybe,"" grandpa shrugged, ""Perhaps you can ask me again on your next visit in a day or two.""<br /><br />""Next visit?!"" I shouted, ""I'm not touching that sauce ever again! Except maybe per drop. Diluted in very large amounts of some sort of substrate like chilli. I-""<br /><br />Grandpa smiled and interrupted, ""You only have a few seconds left. You'll be back at least once more, I know that for sure.""<br /><br />""For sure?"" I asked genuinely confused.<br /><br />Grandpa tiled his head, looking at me like I had just grown a third eye, ""Well yeah. You already ate the stuff, and what goes in has to come out eventually.""<br /><br />My face cracked and was painted with the same look a deer must have in the headlights of an approaching freight train that is powered by several JATO motors. Before I could seek further council I was grasped firmly by an unknown force and suddenly yanked away. The light got sucked into darkness and the roar of passing wind deafened me. I was falling.<br /><br />Soon something came into focus, approaching fast. It was the ground, rushing to greet me with the eagerness of a freshman salesperson thinking they've identified an easy mark. I began screaming, as if that would help. My life didn't flash before my eyes, I didn't have any final profound thoughts, my whole head was filled with paralyzing unmitigated terror. Closer, closer, closer. The ground hurled itself towards me in excitement to say hello to my face with a big wet, red kiss. And just as I'm 1mm away from contact...<br /><br />I jerk upright on my couch, back in my house. Sweaty and tongue numb, cat still sitting on the floor looking as plain as can be. I breathe a heavy sigh of relief, although doing so has a noticeable heat to it due to the remnants of the sauce. I hold my head in my hands and try to regain composure, reassuring myself it was just some weird dream brought on by everyday stress combined with the sudden shock of the ghost pepper sauce. My eyes drift around coming to rest on a stack of papers on the coffee table. Legal papers? I'm... I'm suing myself?<br /><br />I've since been eating lots of cheese and chocolate hoping to stave off the inevitable second visit to Grandpa.<br /><br />This sauce is hot. Really hot. Use a drop at a time in large volumes of other stuff that needs a bit of heat.<br /><br />Pros: Ultra super mega hot. Nice bright, festive color - If HGTV did a makeover of Satan's house they'd probably paint the living room with this stuff for the color.<br />Cons: Flavor is made irrelevant due to the absurd level of heat. No stopper in the bottle's neck so be careful about pouring."

I am a lover of hot sauces and have heard about the nuclear qualities of the Ghost Pepper. I had heard that it needed 2 keys turned at the same time just to open the bottle.. The label claims it is a ""great industrial cleaner and grease remover"".. Bah, enough I said. I had made some Turkey chili previously and had some leftovers so what a great way to try this ""So hot it's spooky"" sauce. I put a tiny bit on my pinky and licked it off, immediately my lips,toungue and mouth were tingling. It tickled my fancy. After a few minutes I began to sweat and my face flushed a bit. Bah... No worries. My wife sampled a drop on the end of a toothpick and was burning up for almost an hour. I splashed a drop into my chili, stirred it and nothing. Felt no heat, dropped some more in.. stirred it and let it set, mmmm good heat... I went do put some more sauce in and a quarter sized glob ejaculated out. I stirred it, let it set and Holy Hell... What a difference. I instantly began sweating, my nose was dripping and my sinus cavity was conflagrated. I loved it. I ate more, it got worse. My hearing diminshed and my eyes were burning. I ate more chili, my esophagus burned. I kept on going, had some milk. I finished the bowl in about 20 mins. I felt like death. It hit my stomach and it felt like a WWF battle royal in there. I got dizzy, had to sit down.. I became soft spoken and started to burp a lot. The next 2 hours created so much bubbly gas that I farted about every 30 seconds, some so loud that it registered on the Richter scale. I felt better. I survived. I had to work the next day. I am a firefigher and am used to heat. I had to poop. I never felt more of a delightfully different burn coming out of me. I had 3 of these episodes in about an hour. Putting a roll of toilet paper in the freezer would have helped quell the fire. I laughed, the guys on my shift laughed.<br /><br /> All in all, it's really a great tasting sauce with a lot of heat.

It is obviously not made for just plopping on your food, more likely mixing in a large bowl of chili (or for pranking your friends). Although this stuff is RIDICULOUSLY hot, it actually has some taste compared to other sauces of similar potency. I has an interesting smokey flavor and tastes like straight-up jolokia. Doing the toothpick test with this is bearable, but the heat sneaks up on you about 2-3 minutes in and it lingers for eternity. Wherever you placed the toothpick will temporarily feel like you actually burned it there. Yeah, its hot!<br /><br />Please know what you are getting into if you buy this. It is a sauce with extract in it and is VERY hot. The especially sneaky part is that the temperature creeps up on you and takes a few minutes to really kick. This is not a sauce you would put directly on your food like tobasco or something. Be warned!"

Does Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce capture the taste of the pepper?<br /><br />I, for one, absolutely love the fruity, bright taste of the Habanero - yes, Habaneros are hot, but their taste is exquisite; capturing that taste, or complimenting it, in a hot sauce takes real skill. Now, to be honest, I'm not sure what the Bhut Jolokia tastes like in its raw state, as I have yet to have the opportunity to try it (though I am looking for just such an opportunity). I would assume this sauce does the job, considering the ingredient list:<br /><br /> * Naga Jolokia<br /> * hot pepper extract<br /> * salt<br /> * vegetable oil<br /> * roasted garlic pulp<br /> * acetic acid<br /><br />The thing that worried me is that second ingredient - ""hot pepper extract"" is, no doubt, capsaicin. I take issue with including it in this hot sauce, as it artificially raises the heat level. Why not allow the Bhut Jolokia stand on its own? Who cares if the resulting sauce doesn't melt my face off? ""The Source"" or the plethora of has-no-flavor-but-who-cares-because-its-insane-heat-impresses-people hot sauces can do that for me if I am looking for that kind of experience.<br /><br />Overall, this sauce has a decent flavor if you can get past the distracting quantity of heat. I suppose I should have expected the company that gave us ""Dave's Insanity Sauce"" to miss the mark, since heat seems to be their only goal; none of ""Dave's Gourment"" sauces has ever impressed me with flavor, I shouldn't fault them for merely being consistent. :)"

What made me a fan of Dave's hot sauces, is the smoky flavor that still comes through despite the heat.<br /><br />My last bottle of Dave's original insanity sauce was running out, and I thought I'd give a different one a try. I decided on the Ghost Pepper hot sauce because it has good review and free shipping from Amazon. I received the shipment very fast, it almost feel like next day although I certainly did not pay for that option. I tried the hot sauce in a stew I made by just putting a couple of drops in my bowl. It's got good heat like the original, but I find the flavor lacking a little. It's got a different flavor that reminds me of a Louisiana style hot sauce, but not quite as tangy. It's just as hot, though I don't feel it's much hotter, than the original.<br /><br />I have to say that I was a little disappointed.

I would apply it liberally to many different dishes, if I didn't value my sanity so highly.<br /><br />The experience differs from other sauces.  With other hot foods (even mild ones like jalape&ntilde;os), it's a pretty straightforward battle: it's spicy, I ate it, and now it's burning my mouth.  Then there's this sauce (and other ghost pepper-based foods), which is a whole different thing... instead of it burning me, it feels like *I'm* the one burning and I just didn't notice it until now.  It's a fun twist.<br /><br />Word to the wise: this stuff builds up over time.  When the bottle first arrived, I put a tiny dot of it on a french fry just to check it out.  I tolerated that small amount with no problem, but it'll sneak up on you.  It started with a mild tingle, and built to a noticeable sting over the course of about five minutes.  If you forget this fact, you'll eat an enchilada with a bit of sauce on every bite and finish the meal feeling like a champ... only to be rendered speechless and near-catatonic ten minutes later.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this sauce to anyone who *isn't* just in it for the bragging rights.  And for those who are: I've felt more burn than this, but not often and rarely from such small amounts of the ""active ingredient""."

One teaspoon in a bowl of chili is sufficient to release a torrent of endorphins and cause the eater to sweat profusely. After accidentally adding too much Ghost Sauce to one bowl of chili, my wife made me take a shower before she'd get close to me. It was as if nearly every pore in my body opened up and went into overdrive producing sweat.<br /><br />Don't expect to get much flavor out of this sauce. It's all about heat. If you're looking for something that tastes great on its own, you'd best look elsewhere. But if it's heat your after, you've chosen the right product. I always add a good dose of Tabasco sauce for flavor, but Tabasco is pretty puny when it comes to setting my mouth on fire. Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce gets the job done!"

That was merely good storytelling rather than a truthful review of this sauce. The sauce has a very pleasant fruity tasty but not from any additives but rather from the natural taste of the ghost chili the main ingredient (although it has an odd smell like sweaty socks). Its no where near as hot as Dave's original insanity sauce. I can eat it a drop or two at a time on a corn chip or in a taco and the burn is moderate to hot but not crazy hot, whereas Dave's original insanity sauce would make a whole pot of chili burn with just a drop or two. This is one of my favorite sauces now. I bought a bottle a month ago and it is about 1/3 gone whereas Daves insanity lasted me years ( unless my tolerance is just growing ;-) ) Enjoy!!!"

I've noticed some of these reviews saying it tastes/smells nasty - I suspect a bad batch - because what I just had is really quite tasty. Its also very, very hot. I had a quarter sized dollop on a corn chip (after a couple smaller doses) - and its a really quite excellent 15 minutes burn - tears, sweat, red face and a nice endorphined finish. That being said, I've had raw habaneros that seemed hotter, and lasted longer (it's all pretty subjective). There were no hiccups, or that panicky feeling you sometimes get when you've had something ""way too hot"". It ramps up nicely, and crests at about 10 minutes; gone in 15. I suspect this stuff is some portion of the heat of a raw jolokia pepper, but not really on par with the real thing (hard to say since I've not yet had one). So, yeah, really great burn without being over the top. And its quite a nice hot sauce too - smoky and a little sweet. There may be hotter sauces out there, but this is just a good hot sauce, that happens to be face-meltingly hot, as well. In all actuality, as hot as ""edible"" gets - any hotter and you really wouldn't want it on a taco. Fun at parties, and highly recommended."

But it's hot for hot's sake: the sauce is really just a heat delivery system, without really bringing anything to the party in terms of flavor. It smells like it should have some of the smoky sweetness of a good jolokia sauce, but if you can actually pick up any distinctive flavors behind the wall of heat it generates in your mouth I'd be surprised.<br /><br />Second, the texture of this sauce is just off. I know Dave's sauces tend to be thicker than most, but this is practically a paste. The thickness causes two major problems. The sauce is difficult to dose out, tending to either catch in the bottle's neck or plop out in large dollops well beyond what any reasonable person would want. Also, it's hard to distribute across your food.<br /><br />Third, it's impractical. Something this hot and thick is far more useful as an ingredient than a condiment, but even when I'm making spicy food I seldom have need for anything this potent. I can't imagine using it on a slice of pizza or in scrambled eggs.<br /><br />Sauces like Holy Jolokia and Naga Soreass will let you experience the subtle flavors that come with the intense heat of the pepper. Dave's Ghost Pepper just gives the heat, without really showcasing the pepper itself.<br /><br />Get it for when you make large pots of chili or when you want to haze fraternity pledges. Otherwise, stick with thinner sauces that have some versatility."

Never mind the warning on the label marked ""Intense++"" or the fact it says the sauce doubles as an industrial degreaser! Onto my story, a co-worker had brought some of this colon cleaner into the office. I noticed a group of co-workers huddled around sticking toothpicks into a mysterious red bottle. Come to find out it is Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce. Being the connoisseur of spicy foods and sauces that I am, I couldn't help but chuckle inside at my co-workers. Using toothpicks to try hot sauce? Really? PANSIES! So I did the only logical thing, I had to show them up! I grabbed the bottle (before reading anything on the label), put a dime size drop on my hand, and promptly licked it off! The first few seconds were magical, Dave's sauce packs a wallop of flavors, however before I could even discern what flavors those were, my enjoyment quickly turned to ""Holy crap, that was a bad idea"". My tongue and lips were instantly on fire! Being use to many different spicy and fiery foods, I knew I would be ok, but since I was not expecting the tongue punching that I just received I was taken back. For the next 5 minutes or so my tongue was tingling and so was my poor lips, which by the way had an open wound from me biting down on it during dinner the night before. That's another story, but as you could imagine it did not help one bit! Anyways, this sauce is damn good and I immediately ordered some last night to add to my pantry. This is definitely a sauce that should be used in moderation and will be awesome mixed together with actual food or other condiments. Not recommended for solitary consumption."

It is sweetly smoky, but this lasts only for the initial few seconds before the blazing, unquenchable inferno from the pit of hell begins. My eyes watered. Sweat formed on my brow. My nose ran. Brutal... just brutal. Another friend poured this stuff on his burger like ketchup (dripping down the side), and ate it like it was nothing!

As such, it does not surprise me that many people find this sauce TOO hot.  I do not.  It is perfect thus far.  My experiences in different foods follow.<br /><br />First Taste : Drop on my finger : At first, great aroma and flavor.  Then, the heat started to build and hit max fairly quickly.  With other sauces I have found this means it will then die down, however Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce lingers.  The burn lasted a good long while (I would estimate 15-20 minutes, with pretty much a glass or 2 of water).<br /><br />Chicken Alfredo : Afraid that the drop on my tongue was unrepresentative and the heat would de-intensify with food, I put on 4 or 5 drops to a medium bowl of Chicken Alfredo. This was a tad too much.  It didn't kill me, but wow did I drink several glasses of water.<br /><br />Wendy's Chili : I loved this so much I picked up another bottle from a store nearby work that carried it and thought it would do well in Wendy's Chili (which is close by).  I put one drop first and tried.  Not quite enough.  I put another drop and it was perfect.  While Wendy's chili is certainly not the best, this hot sauce made it all that much better!<br /><br />Hamburger : I purchased a Jalapeno burger patty from Stater Bros (local food chain).  2 drops mixed with other condiments (Chipoltle Mayo and Jalepeno Mustard) was perfect.  It added the desired amount of heat and flavor (did I mention this sauce has a fantastic flavor!?!?)<br /><br />Chili Mac : Made with ground turkey.  Yep, this is a pretty low ball dish.  I meant to put 2 drops, but wound up with 1 drop and a dollop the equivalant of 3, so 4 total.  I'm not sure if I'm just building up resistance, but this was awesome.  It wasn't so hot as to have me sweating, but it was a definite (and enjoyable) battle to finish it!<br /><br />I have tried all of the ""usual suspects"" (Tapatio, Trader Joe's Jabanero (which also isn't bad)) in addition to Melinda's Ghost Pepper Sauce, and this is my favorite by far due to both heat and flavor.  Melinda's has a fantastic flavor, but leaves much to be desired in the heat department.<br /><br />Feel free to clue me in to great tasting hot (and hotter) sauces.  I have always been a fan of ""heat"", but now I am an addict (thanks to Dave's Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce!!!)."
566803,B001PQTYN2,A3A8S3C9FHPY3N,"Eric Marshall ""-Eric""",1,1,5,1331078400,New Favorite Sauce- Compared to Dave's original,"I like to think of the potent flavors found in Dave's line of sauces sort of like Stinky cheeses. Some people hate them, some people love them, and there is a lot of subjectivity so any review that regards the flavors or smells as good or bad must be taken with a grain of salt because it's all about personal preference. I'm not saying that Dave's sauces taste like foot cheese, just pointing out another ""food group"" that can pack some very pungent strong flavors and smells that some people find very repulsive. Dave sauces are thick with ingredient and not ""watered"" down or full of vinegar. They have a very strong smell and flavor that some people may not like. I think that like fancy cheeses, dark beers, or black coffee, powerful hot sauces like Dave's are an acquired taste that takes time to appreciate.<br /><br />I find the Ghost pepper version here to lean sweeter and smokier than the original dave's by quite a bit and like both very much but for different reasons. Heat level is very hard to compare amongst things unless they are orders of magnitude different. The Ghost bottle has one more ""+"" next to the ""insanity"" rating than the original but I find that heat level ""ratings"" within an already very hot group of sauces are not very important since it really all comes down to how much capsicum is ingested and how much comes into contact with the sensitive parts of the mouth/throat. The long term cost of desiring a spicy hit at nearly every meal is actually lower with sauces in this category because they do the trick in small doses. My limit is about a teaspoon on a meal and that makes for a very powerful endorphin response that leaves me rather incapacitated for about a half hour after meal time. Usually use less than that but everyone once and awhile pepper heads feel the need to push limits and cause some real pain. I  have noticed that different sauces (made from different peppers) have different heat ""behaviors."" Some are a hard hitting short duration burn in the mouth and on lips, and some you can feel as a warm buzzing through the torso for hours after eating them. The extract used in Dave's sauces seems to be a pretty good blend of both of those attributes, but I would say that the ghost pepper adds a more drawn out, building style heat that effects the ""whole body"" rather than just the mouth more-so than the Original Dave's Insanity Sauce.<br /><br />My bottle of Dave's Original Insanity was almost empty, so I picked this Ghost variant up at World Market as it would be a shame not to have another bottle of magma ready to go. I couldn't resist opening it right away and trying it out. The first experience with it left me wondering if I might have an allergy to it as it caused some sensations I had not felt with other sauces. The more I used it, the more I started to appreciate it's ""effects."" From my subjective point of view, it is the best flavor in any hot sauce I have ever had. I usually get bottles of various ""normal"" heat hot sauces (watered down habanero, jolepeno, chipotle, watered down cayenne) around the holidays from family members and most of them are enjoyable, but none can compare to this. I can only attribute the flavor to the Ghost pepper as no other sauce I have ever tried has has the particular flavor found in this sauce. The only ingredient that is ""out of the ordinary"" here to explain that is the Ghost peppers themselves.  If you've tasted the flavor of many pepper sauces and are looking for something ""new"" this has to be tried. The original Dave's insanity sauce contains a lot of pulverized, likely concentrated onion that gives it an addictive pungency that some would describe as ""smalling like something that should be used to strip paint."" The Ghost pepper variant does have a touch of garlic but does not come across to me as being anywhere near as pungent as the original (keep in mind, I liked the original, for the same sort of reason I suspect, that people take a liking to ""stinky"" powerful cheeses).<br /><br />Oh yea... one final consideration... Be careful with it, it's pretty warm. I'd suggest against pranking people with it as there is some potential liability there that is not worth it IMO."

This one sets the standard for hot sauces of this genre.<br /><br />I've tried several hundred (maybe a thousand by now) and have been making my own sauces for over 4 years, I've grown several gardens dominated by Jolokia peppers and have made some pretty wicked all Jolokia pepper home brew versions; however, Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce is still very hard to beat.  His Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia ""select sauce"" is a notch better, but for the price of about 3 bottles of his select sauce, you can get a gallon of Jolokia pepper sauce, and this is the quantity that I get.<br /><br />My favorite use of this sauce is to impress guests who think they can handle heat, mixing it with other commercial or homebrew sauces, putting a dab in ranch for salad, and eating it with just about everything except sweets or cereal.  I'll keep trying every hot sauce known to man leaving no stone unturned, creating my own with my own Jolokias, Habaneros (etc.), but you'll never catch me without plenty of this one around."

I am thinking that maybe people have different reactions to pepper types, because sauces with cayenne pepper, even if they are not as potent, seem ""hotter"" to me.<br /><br />The other thing that leads me to think this is that I am not an experienced chilihead, and was careful about trying this sauce carefully.  A tiny droplet on a chip led to a great smoky initial taste, and a growing burn that topped out at hot, but very manageable.  This lead to more and more over the next day, and my comfort level tops out at a small pour into a cup of chili gives it nice taste and a solid burn that I can deal with, and I can still feel hours later- in a good way.<br /><br />A fine sauce, I thought this 5 oz bottle would last forever, but I can already see that I will run out sooner than expected."

566808,B001PQTYN2,A3J1NV9I9PHCRU,Roman736,1,1,4,1320278400,Kick to it,"I will preface this review with a little about myself. I only recently bought a ""hottest sauce"" while at a kind of flea market in England. It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn. At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it, but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment.  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it. So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goes:<br /><br />The sauce is very hot. Almost too hot. It has a pasty consistency, almost exactly like tomato paste. Very finely ground. It has a more gummy consistency to it, like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though there's no such actual ingredient.<br /><br />What there is, however, as someone else pointed out, is pepper extract. It's the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount. Perhaps it's what's giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier. This Pepper Extract doesn't state what KIND of pepper, and as it's an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction process.<br /><br />So what I'm getting at is this: the sauce feels more like a pepper extract, something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food. But it's missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce. There's little flavor, just a lot of burn. And I have to say that that's a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty. Almost fruity if I remember correctly.<br /><br />So I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice, but I won't give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle. The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it, and it was much more like salsa, with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to, if not more burn than this one.<br /><br />If I change my mind as I go through this bottle, I'll update or comment on here again."

I just went down to the kitchen to smell it again and it does have a smokey,spicey woody smell to it. Had this with grilled stired eggplant and as a testament to this sauce, it didn't destroy the flavor of the mellow eggplant stirfry. Be careful when pouring as this bottle doesn't have a restrictor. But it does come out thick and pours slow enough. Had porkchops on the side & this sauce seemed to bypass the actual food & leave you with the heat in back of the throat. Not the most flavorful hot sauce but appropriate for chilli, Crock pot stews and the like. Also, I like hot sauces to be done soon after dinner.

I'm sure this is too make it not so hot but I figured this might cover up it's natural taste too.<br /><br />So I stopped at Taco Bell on the way home. Figured start with something mild and got a ranchero chicken soft taco. Put one drop of this stuff and smeared it around. Not bad. Complimented it nicely. Second was a meximelt. One drop only again. This time it seemed they merged together and boosted each others spices. By the time I was done I had a nice long heat going and some sweats which lasted untill I got home.<br /><br />You know when you take a shot of hard liquor on an empty stomach? That burn?

I have bought the habanero version of Tabasco and didn't care for it. That was mainly vinegar with way too much of a black pepper type taste. It is hot, but I ended up throwing that away. This however, I definetly will be buying more of!!! It may overpower your food if you use too much of it, but for most part it merges with your food and creates a new flavor. Those who said it tasted bad or metallic must have had a bad batch.<br /><br />By the way, me, i'm not....well wasn't a big chili person untill recently.

If I put a toothpick into it and put it at the tip of my tongue, there is noticeable heat.  When it comes time to eat a meal, I prefer to put a drop or so into my individual portion to get really freakin noticeable heat.  The stuff is no joke.

I put hot sauce on pretty much everything and habanero started to loose its umph some time ago.  After preparing some spaghetti, I turned the bottle upside down and tried to shake the paste-like sauce into my bowl.  Excited, I began to smack the bottle.  I probably knocked 6-7 drops into my bowl.  Then I read the bottle, which belatedly instructed me to use one drop.  About 4-5 mins into dinner it hit me; my lips went numb and I began to sweat.  Shortly thereafter my nose began to run.  I went a little bit lighter on the next bowl- like 3 drops.  This was still extremely hot- I continued to sweat and became a little dizzy.  I don't see this stuff bringing a grown man down.  However, it is a half hour later and I think that I am high.  I am also afraid of what tomorrow might bring.  Although this is a must have for those who like hot sauce, you should seriously be weary... it is indeed hot!"
566818,B001PQTYN2,A3J3CDYXQ60Q48,NeciFiX,3,4,5,1284681600,Death in a Glass Bottle,"Alright.<br /><br />I'm just a sixteen, almost seventeen year old kid. High School Student, bored and wanting to buy some cool stuff. I tend to blow all of my money on cool internet stuff... I figured hot sauce was the next best route to take. I've tried a lot of neat stuff from cool organic pills that change bitter foods to sweet and insane prank sprays, but, I figured this would be my next step in the process.<br /><br />Wow. Just wow. I bought this stuff last week and it arrived this Friday, after picking it up with a good friend of mine, Brandon, at the post office, we headed home. I opened the package and we both vastly underestimated this product. He took a lot of this stuff. A lot. Probably a good-sized spoonful, at once. He was crying. A sheen of sweat covered his face as he fell on the kitchen floor, panting. Water, milk, bread, nothing worked. It was pure agony. He is a spicy fan, so, I was surprised to see this from him. Hesitant myself, as I'm not a big fan of spicy foods, I tried it. I saw the darkness. My left ear felt like it was about to explode and there was a trail of fire leading down my esophagus.<br /><br />I began to stumble around my kitchen, grabbing popsicles and milk and water. I had vastly underestimated the potential of this sauce. It is the destroyer of worlds. I'm not experienced with this stuff, but, my friend is, and it is the hottest thing he's ever had by miles. This stuff is 400x hotter than tabasco sauce on the Scoville scale.<br /><br />I invited my friends Rob, Matt and Cyrus over. Rob barely had a dab and nearly died, Matt took a small amount on a spoon and then downed a glass of milk and said ""That's nothing"" and smirked, then, a moment later, began swearing and freaking out, grabbing his bottle of fruit juice he brought over and chugging it. Cyrus began to cry and pant heavily. This stuff is amazing. Simply amazing. I added one good sized drop to some tomato soup I made for dinner, as well as a lot of other delicious spices (I'm great at makin'  the stuff) and it really added a lot of flavor and a good amount of heat without making it overbearing.<br /><br />This sauce tastes really good and, as long as you aren't making your friends eat the stuff straight out to witness their horrified reactions, it will last an extremely long time. Do not drink this stuff straight out of the bottle without putting it on some sort of food. Trust me, unless you're looking for a kick, this is not a joke. This stuff is insane, I guess that's why it says ""INSANE++"" on the bottle. To quote Rob, ""It's not hot anymore... IT JUST HURTS!!"" Careful with this stuff!"

I tried it out with a Baltimore City cop and we were on our knees for 10 minutes, He said it was almost as bad as pepper spray and this was from a tooth-pick dab straight. My little brother screamed and I had eye sweats, serious pain followed by drug like euphoria.<br /><br />Now, if you use it like food and put on or in something, it is much more manageable.<br /><br />This bottle will end up living in many people's fridges forever, but it works great as a heat source for chili and is very tasty on chicken. If you just use it to harm your friends as a party trick, that's fine, but it has a nice flavor when consumed with a little restraint.<br /><br />The ""real deal"", seriously hot enough for any purpose, will probably keep deer out of your garden."

I had used about 1/3 of the bottle so I knew what I was getting myself into. I must have not realized that the oil was too hot to add liquid to without causing it to vaporize. Instantly after pouring it in it began to boil violently. A sizeable cloud of Dave's hot sauce quickly formed above the pan. I thought it would be OK at first. I backed off after getting a small whiff of it. It was very potent--like mace. After about 25 seconds I couldn't stop coughing but I continued cooking thinking that just the small whiff had gotten into the wrong place in my throat and I would soon return to normal. Little did I know that it's vapors were spreading throughout the house. Within minutes my roommates were coughing across the house. My dog was also wheezing.<br />After opening all the windows and doors in the house and turning some fans on I ate my egg/vegetable patty sandwich.

I'll focus on what jumped out at me in particular. First off, when you open up the bottle (after shaking it to death, just like you should on all extract sauces) you notice an aroma distinctly vinegar, with naga fruitieness and a hint of garlic. The taste is just amazing! You can't even taste the extract over the powerful naga sweetness. The one area you will surely notice the extract is in your stomach. Never use this stuff on an already empty stomach, best to prime the pumps. Even an iron gut may fall pray to uncontrollable stomach cramps. And yes, this stuff is pretty hot. Way to hot for most people in fact, even though I was only able to make my bottle last a week (did I mention that I eat whole naga jolokia peppers with no liquid or food?).

I have the 5oz. bottle at home and have nearly consumed it in that time, and also keep a smaller bottle (obtained from the 4-pack gift crate) at work.  The odor/flavor is reminiscent of Tabasco, but with a level of bite that would grab ANYBODY's notice.<br /><br />First, I should say that I never use this directly as a food topping, but instead blend it into a sauce of one sort or another.  I practically live off of Bird's Eye Lightly Sauced vegetables (one of which is a penne in alfredo sauce, another is rigatoni/vegetables in tomato parmesan), and this stuff complements them nicely.  Cut a hole in the bag, pour a liberal dose in, and shake the bag up until the contents are thoroughly mixed.  In the case of the alfredo sauce, I enjoy the heat at the point where the sauce has taken to a light orange tinge, but mileage may vary.  It mixes nicely with ketchup as well.  I would recommend a 1:10 ratio between the hot sauce and whatever base you're combining it with, but this is purely a matter of preference.<br /><br />I would only assume that if you're reading this, you already know the heat that a ghost pepper packs, and if you want scare stories feel free to read the other reviews.

It works great with chili and mexican food.<br /><br />I expected it to be more like a ghost pepper (which I've eaten raw) but it wasn't as close as I imagined. However it does have that flavor, if that's what you like. It's a smoky flavor with a lot of heat.<br /><br />It was shipped fast and everything I expected. Good stuff!"

I will have to agree with the above reviews in regards to the heat index. I tried the smallest dab on the end of my fork and must say the taste is good, kind of a cross with tabasco and louisiana hot sauce but the burning sensation of a thousand fire ants stinging the inside of my mouth quickly blocked the ability to taste anymore.<br />After mixing with a bit of other hot sauce in the fridge the ghost pepper sauce is a lot easier on the system. Still had a sweat on but at least I can handle it now."

566857,B001PQTYN2,A369D4HXAVASS6,John,0,0,5,1326931200,Item definitely as described,"Received this a day earlier than the estimated ETA (ordered 1/16 and received 1/19).  It showed up packaged nicely in big thick bubble wrap contained within an innocent-looking plain shipping box.  Didn't know it had arrived until I checked my tracking status through amazon and seen that it had delivered.  Went out to the mailbox a little bit ago and brought it in.  Not sure how long it was out there, but I think it was partially frozen (current outside temp is 10 degrees).  However - frozen or not - this stuff means business.<br /><br />I actually hesitated for a bit before breaking the plastic seal and opening the bottle.  Tried telling myself that I may as well let it thaw before opening - yet I think I was just stalling.  For better or worse, though, I decided to open it up and give it a try.  Using a small narrow measuring spoon (1/8 teaspoon I believe) I put a small dab of this lava-colored stuff on the end of the spoon.  Hesitated for a bit longer before placing spoon in my mouth and seeing what it was all about.  It took roughly 1 second before my tongue gave me that info in short order.<br /><br />Immediate taste was very pleasant with a taste of its own for this particular pepper sauce.  I am by no means a 'chili head' or enjoy eating a lot of hot sauce with my food, but I can say that I did enjoy the flavor more than tobasco or habanero sauce.  However, the flavor was almost immediately dwarfed by an intense burning sensation on my tongue which made its way down my throat.  After about a minute or so the burning was in full effect with sinuses cleared and my complete undivided attention directed toward pain management.  Call me a wuss, but I ended up going for a glass of milk about 3 or 4 minutes after tasting a very small dab of this stuff.  It's truly amazing how fast milk can provide nearly instant relief from this type of pain.  Nearly an hour later and my tongue still has a slight burning sensation lingering where initial contact was made.<br /><br />Use with caution.  As others have stated - the bottle does not have a regulator cap.  Mine had a thick consistency which was probably due to it being partially frozen.  But even at a very cold temperature, this hot sauce will seem like a gift from Prometheus himself."

My mom, grandfather, etc all grew their own chili gardens and we had handmade chili at just about ever meal growing up so I'm not try any new chili I get a chance to. I got a chance to try this one when I visited my uncle that had just bought a bottle. He told me how he had pranked several people at work with it and they thought it way very very hot. He didn't think so himself. After trying it myself I can say it's hot enough. Up there with a bottle of habanero. See thing is after a chili is as hot as a habanero you really don't need anything hotter. If you pour more than a teaspoon at a time you are asking for trouble/pain. Just a single drop was enough to get my eyes to water and tongue to burn all over. I was disappointed that it didn't get hotter over time since I saw some other people reviewing this chili where they said it got hotter over time and burned all the way down to their stomach. I guess if I tried to down the whole bottle at once, but I'm not crazy enough to do that!"

Fast forward to thanksgiving, I had a guest over that considered himself a ""hot sauce connoisseur"" and able to handle any kind of heat. I let him know to use only one drop, he ignored my warning a proceeded to douse his turkey the fiery red liquid. After finishing the first slice he was in obvious pain, profusely sweating, and he seemed on the verge of crying. Three beer and two glasses of milk later he seemed to approach normal again.

I thought that maybe I could trigger my own endorphins to take up some of the weight. I started with jalapenos, and that worked for a little while, but it's a lot to eat. So I tried some regular grocery-store hot sauces, and I was swigging them just to get a decent burn. Then I decided to go for something very hot and found Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Sauce. Little dabs with my finger to my tongue causes a good burn, but it took a bit more than a dab to get the endorphin burn going. Each endorphin burn gets rid of the headache/sinus pain for about an hour. Still, it's the best I've tried yet. I've read it runs 650,000 scoville units, at 130x the heat of a jalapeno."

We began using the pod coffee system years ago when the Home Cafe systems were introduced (before the current K-cup models). The pod coffee system is perfect for our household, and Senseo is just about the only manufacturer still offering the pods. My husband rotates the Columbian with Sumatra and Expresso pods, but the Columbian is his favorite, and he says that it is a very rich and flavorful blend. The aroma when the coffee is brewing is wonderful, and for anyone who only drinks a few cups, this system is probably as cost effective as brewing a pot of coffee and throwing out half the pot; plus, with this system, every cup is fresh, not stale or left-over. The Columbian is a rich and dark blend and perfect for coffee drinkers who want a traditional flavor of coffee."

They look just like the picture on the box, they are so soft and chewy and the taste is delicious. They come in a vacume sealed package so I suggest once you open them you place the entire package minus the box in a gallon sized zip lock bag because they will go stale quickly. I experienced this when my hubby was ""sleep walking"" and opened up the box and placed the package back in the box and the next morning they were all hard and stale. We ended up eating them over the course of a couple days with milk/coffee and dunking them. Another way I store them is in a air tight container I picked up at the doller store and placed each cookie in a sandwich bag and placed them in the jar. That way when I'm packing the hubby's lunch I just grab a cookie in its sandwich bag and throw it into his lunch pale. I mention my husband alot because he constantly talks about these cookies to his friends, we had one of them come over the other day and he ran over to the jar and had him try one. His friend was HOOKED now he is also a loyal customer as is his wife. We don't really care for the raisin variety which is sad because I typically love raisin cookies.

Only 8g of sugar per cookie, and 5g of fat which is a tad higher than I would have liked but I would guess if they had cut more fat out they would have sacrificed a lot of the taste. The cookies are a little smaller than I was expecting, and like others have previously said they are kind of dry, but neither factor really bothers me.

Her brother, who's a chef, recommended it.  I went to 4 different stores looking for it. It never dissapoints. If I need a quick dinner, I take an 8 piece cut-up chicken, pour a little olive oil over it, rub it in, then sprinkle the rotisserie seasoning over it (maybe 1-3 tbsp), rub that in, too, and that's it. No salt and pepper is needed.  Sometimes I cut up onions and put them in the bottom of the pan.

Once brewed, the flavor was just blah.  I only bought a few ounces of it, but it is still here 5 months later.  I am now mixing it up with my other teas just to use it up.  If you prefer a more mellow taste, this may be more appealing to you (and my 7 year old daughter does enjoy the aroma of this one).

I'm not a coffee guru...I can't really go in depth about the flavors, aromas, depth, etc....I can tell you that with Lavazza Cafe Espresso i get a palpable caffeine jolt from a 14 gram double espresso extracted over 20 seconds on my gaggia. Not really fond of the taste. I use Cafe Espresso for iced espressos and americanos. I can sort of taste some chocolate and nutty flavors, it does have a bit of a sweet taste, but it seems to have a lingering bitterness. Lavazza In Blue has a cleaner aftertaste and is more chocolatey. In Blue is a bit smoother as well. Illy Is my favorite, clean after taste, not bitter, smoother than both. Plus it seems to have a bit more caffeine kick...but i think that's just mental or maybe because i drink Illy as a straight shot. If you don't mind spending the money, I would buy Illy. If you find it ludicrous to spend $12 on 8 ounce coffee, which i doubt since you probably have a nice machine if you are reading this, I would buy Lavazza In Blue (i can get it for $8 at World Market). If you just want a preground espresso to make coffee drinks, or iced drinks and don't want to spend too much nor buy a burr grinder and grind your own, i would get the Lavazza Cafe Espresso. Still waiting to try Oro and Illy Dark roast.<br />Lavazza Cafe Espresso would get 3.5/5 from me. In Blue would get 4/5, Illy 4.5/5."

I tried both coffee made in Bialetti Moka Express Stovetop Espresso Maker.<br />My opinion - they definetely have different taste but no difference in quality. Lavazza tastes stronger, while Illy tastes softer. Thus, I cannot justify such significant difference in price - $13 per 8oz. for Illy and $5 per 8oz. for Lavazza. I personally liked Lavazza taste better.<br /><br />Illy makes grind especially for Stovetop Moka Maker which I used. Apparently it is designed to be completely filtered out  - so there is no tiny bits of grounded coffee in the final product and no powder left in cup when it is empty. For some reason I do like these little pieces in the mouth (probably it is not good for teeth). Lavazza makes just one standard ground coffee which in finer than Illy's Moka version."

They lack the fat of popcorn (except for the air popped corn which is not worth the effort).  They have a certain richness from baking, a taste which ties it right back to the beer from which it derived its malty goodness.<br />These pretzels are great in another way: you can only eat so much at any one sitting.  They take a certain effort to eat, unlike chips, so there's no danger you will eat the whole box.<br />My recommendation before eating is to part-open the bag and then break all the pretzels.  The reason is two fold: you get a variety of shapes and sizes, plus they are much easier to eat.  If you chomp into a whole pretzel, you will discover that you had dental problems that you never knew you had.  So, better not 'test' yourself and just give them a satisfying and productive bash in the bag before eating.  Enjoy..."

We tried a much smaller bag of this food, which lasted about 2 weeks, and our dog seemed to love it.  Bought the larger bag, dog had first serving, then threw up.  Second serving; threw up. After that she refused to eat it. Perhaps a bad batch?<br /><br />I switched back to the previous variety (at less cost) and the dog is happy.<br /><br />I'd avoid this variety in the large, expensive bag until you've spent 4 weeks using it from smaller bags.  You don't want to get stuck with a $85+ bag of dog food that your dog rejects."

I previously bought K-cups on a regular basis, but due to constant price increases that luxury has ended for me.<br /><br />What I discovered:<br />- this twin pack lasted me 5 weeks (equal to 105 K-cups at 3 cups per day X 35 days)<br />- I paid $13.99 (K-cup boxes would have cost me $59.98 at $29.99 per box X 2)<br />- the flavor was fabulous, just like the K-cups<br />- you can control strength by choosing more or less coffee in the Ekobrew (I fill to the max)<br /><br />I'm very happy now! I can still use my Keurig, get a great cup of coffee, for 1/4th of the k-cup price.<br />Sure, it takes me a little longer to make coffee, then rinse out the Ekobrew, but this is still much quicker than using the old auto-drip type coffee maker.<br /><br />Price notes:<br />- NEVER ever pay more than $8.99 per 12oz bag!<br />- I paid $6.99 for ""Starbucks Italian Roast"" at Kroger (on sale)(my favorite coffee!)<br />- I paid $4.50 for ""Caribou Mahogany"" at Publix (buy one, get one free deal)<br />- Dunkin' Donuts coffee costs LESS at Dunkin' Donuts than Amazon<br /><br />In our struggling economy, there are ways to save money with only minor sacrifices.<br />I hope my review has helped,<br />Jeff"

I grew up preferring Strawberry, then Vanilla, and, lastly, chocolate.<br /><br />Then when I was 35, my husband took me with him on a business trip to Switzerland. What a treat that was! Lining the main boulevards were small confectionery shops filled with cocholates the likes of which I had never, ever laid eyes upon. A tiny box of chocolates that would be about 5 inches square and hold 12 pieces of candy cost around $30. But I had no idea that Chocolate could taste so exquistely good or look so beautiful. Little candies with 3 layers of chocolate in various flavors topped with small green candy looking twigs, or hearts, or diamond shapes.<br />Truffles made with plain chocolate or all different types of liquors. If I could have afforded it, I would have eaten myself into the size of a blimp. And the sales people were so delightful, always reminding me that this box was made Today and was meant to be eaten TODAY or it would get stale. I thought about our boxes of chocolate that sit on the shelves for weeks or months and winced. Thankfully, lots of walking was required to see the sights and I was able to eat what I could afford and still not gain! It was like Heaven.<br /><br />But then, back to the States we came. Hersheys just didn't cut it anymore. So I began taste testing what I could find locally always recalling the vendors' words ""that chocolate was made today and is to be eatenn today."" I tried Truffles, I tried mixed boxes whose photos made them LOOK LIKE the insides of the tiny little boxes in Switzerland. But nothing measured up.<br /><br />One day, I was in a local store and sighted these Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. It was my turn to bring treats to a group I go to on Thursdays. The chocolates were on sale and I had noted that the Belgian chocolates I had tried did seem fresher than the others, and tasted better than other brands shipped in Stateside. So I bought two boxes and trooped off to my meeting.<br /><br />As Soon as I had put the chocolate out, I checked to make sure that no one else had brought chocolate as a treat. Nope. Then I took one and ambled away to give them a taste. I wanted to make certain I hadn't bought something awful. So with my back turned to the group, I tried out a piece. I popped the whole thing in my mouth and went through my usualy routine for checking chocolate. I let the piece of candy just lay on my tongue for about 25 seconds until it had softened up and then began lightly and politely sucking on the chocolate. Oh my. It was fresh and had a delightful sweet chocolate taste very similar to the Swiss Chocolate I so loved. In fact, this was just a bit creamier. With little time to spare, I went ahead and bit into the piece expecting solid chocolate. But no, there was a soft inner core of ever sweeter, softer, creamier, fresher, chocolate in the center. I was Delightfully Surprised. Hating to hurry, I went ahead and chewed the piece up so that I could join the group.<br /><br />But my what an experience. I found myself going back to the counter several times during the afternoon, to get another piece of that chocolate I had brought. I urged the others to try it and each one was also very impressed with this chocolate. Where DID you get these? Were they terribly expensive? How long do they keep? Can I put them in my candy jar or will they melt? The SeaShells were an overwhelming success. I shared that I got them at the local pharmacy on the corner, that they were currently on sale, best to eat them as soon as possible, but they will keep in the freezer without problem for a year, and, yes you should be able to keep them in the candy jar as it was then winter here in Arizona, but I would not put them in a jar during the summer. I have found that even with air conditioning, delicate chocolate does not hold up well out of its box when it is hot. Somehow the candies sense the outside heat and their insides get really old and stale and melt. Ugh. Best to keep them in the fridge in the summer. If you buy them on sale as a gift, stick them in the freezer to preserve them like new.<br /><br />I am amazed at how good these are and I do pick them up on sale and pop them in the freezer for gifts, and keep them hidden in the fridge as a treat for myself. They are indeed, the best ""other country, Stateside Product"" I have found. Whatever theis company does is amazing because these tender candies stay fresh and edible for those of us here. So, I highly Recommend them as they are my favorites. I would NOT order them in the summer or when it starts to get warmish at all as they will probably melt in transit unless they are shipped in dry ice, which I do not know. But I only have them shipped in the dead of winter because it can get so warm here at any time.<br /><br />So, If you are a candy eater, and love foreighn chocolates, then get some of these. They are a wonderful treat. I hope you like them as well as I do.!"

But after TASTING these yummy morsels, we knew that these were the BEST chocolate ANYWHERE -- on sale, or not!<br /><br />A few years later, my sister came to visit.  We bought some more Gulian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. (don't remember if they were on sale then or not), in honour of her visit.  She took ONE bite of one....and summed up what my mom and I had thought ever since WE had first tasted them:<br /><br />  ""...I can't believe how good they are!""<br /><br />.......................................................<br /><br />THE REAL REASONS WHY THESE CHOCOLATES ARE S_O GOOD Dept.<br /><br />Many years after her visit, I was watching The History Channel, and they mentioned Belgian chocolate, and showing how it was made.  I remember the voice-over saying that Belgian chocolate is even better than French chocolate -- and giving the reasons for this.<br />1) Belgian chocolates are made from the freshest of the most fresh ingredients.  2) Belgian chocolates are made by people who take IMMENSE PRIDE in their profession, and want to make sure everything is JUST right!<br /><br />.....................................................<br /><br />FALSE ECONOMY.....DON'T GET STUCK LIKE I DID!! Dept.<br /><br />I recently made the mistake of trying to find a ""Belgian Chocolate Bargain"" on Amazon.  Believe it or not, it was an 11-pound BLOCK of Dark Belgian chocolate.  WORST culinary mistake I ever bought, (I won't mention my home-made kitchen disasters here.) The greater the cocoa content, the harder the chocolate, you see.  I don't know if it was mentioned or not....but I probably would have bought this anyway, so delighted am I with BELGIAN chocolate.  I wound up with something SO huge, and SO hard, that I was lucky a friend of mine's husband was able to break it into twelve smaller blocks -- with his home-workshop SAW!  He didn't dare break it into slices, because this could have BROKEN his saw!  So I am left with 12 blocks of approximately 1 1/2"" x 2"" x 3"", that I will probaby have to grate, then powder in my blender.  IF, that is, I don't get disgusted enough to throw the whole thing out.  Sadly, these hard BLOCKS of Belgian chocolate are no longer fresh....or that tasty, either..........<br /><br />...................................................<br /><br />THE ( YUMMY! ) BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />So, for a treat, DON'T look for a super-bargain....even in Belgian Chocolates.  Save money by fore-swearing pizza for a few months, or other such economies.  GUYLIAN BELGIAN CHOCOLATE SEA-SHELLS, (here in the 8.82 ounce ""REGULAR economy"" pack), offers bite-size morsels of true confectionary ART!  They are better than ANY chocolate you have ever tasted -- unless you have tasted Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea-Shells before!  Give them to anyone you appreciate and admire....including yourself.  And you, (or whomever you give them to), will surely echo my sister's words:<br /><br />  "".....I can't believe how good they are!"""

Guylian shells are definitely not something you'll confuse with fresh Belgian pralines.  I'm assuming the freshness issue accounts for the difference in taste between these and something like Corne Toison D'Or in Brussels, or any one of the really good Belgian chocolate-makers whose products are flown here from Belgium and sold immediately or disposed of so that customers only get freshly-made chocolates.<br /><br />Providing one understands these are made economically to survive on the shelf, and are not to be compared to the amazing, delectable but quickly-spoiled types for which one either goes to Brussels or pays a fortune in shipping, I think these make a great, relatively inexpensive chocolate."

The oil is not at all like the seller/manufacturer had described it to be. Doesn't smell or tastes like Hass avocados. Hardly. Tastes more like cooked leafy greens. I am beginning to believe that buying avocado oil online is probably not the best way to go. This is the second brand of avocado oil (also tried San Pietro Chilean Organic avocado oil) I've purchased and both have been horrible. Maybe manufacturers of these oils should be more honest in describing the tastes of these oils so that the consumer would know what to expect. If they say it should taste mild and buttery than that's what one expects. Not citrus-like or herbaceous like described by others consumers. Also, I've read that avocado oil can go rancid despite the date on the bottle. That if it smells and tastes odd then probably it's rancid or on its way there. I've come across lots of oils in my lifetime and never the tought of it being rancid has ever entered my mind. Probably because I've never really come across any until now. Maybe avocado oil is a far to delicate of an oil that needs to be stored and handled in a special manner which too many sellers don't know how to. Anyway, I think I would give some other oil a try.<br /><br />Note: This is a follow up to my review. I wouldn't do business with this company ever again. Besides selling me a bad product, they make me responsible for shipping costs. So that means that instead of the $21.97 reimbursement,  I will only be credited $11.99 and they would not do so unless I ship them back the product which I had to pay $5.  to get it back to them.

I have no idea why I didn't hop on this avocado oil train long ago but I just discovered it at Whole Foods.  This takes salads and meals to a whole other taste level.<br /><br />I try to have a monounsaturated fat at every meal due to the health benefits and the scores of studies as well as personal experience showing they assist in weight loss when combined with a regular proper calorie diet. (These are the good fats) so I include lots of avocados and olive oil in my diet naturally....I'll make salads, pastas, hummus, tapanades for sandwiches, combine beans and corn with avocados etc, make a california veggie burger cooked in olive oil and topped with avocados, red peppers, etc in a pita...so replacing my olive oil with avocado oil has brought on wonderful new flavors.<br /><br />That said, with culinary training under my belt, I'm exceptional at picking out individual flavors in foods and I taste olive oil as a component here as well.  This is made by olivado which I'm assuming is likely an olive oil company by the name so it could simply be they are using the same presses to press out the avocados.  It isn't something that bothers me as I love olive oil, but it gives the avocado flavor a milder taste so I'm anxious to try some other brands as well.<br /><br />I personally feel this is an oil everyone should have on hand.  The flavor is a whole new depth when using oil that is unique and unexpected and I'll always have some, no matter what brand, in my own cabinet. I find myself reaching for this to replace other oils in recipes very often."

Occasionally I just don't have time to fire-up a  brewed cup, so I'm always on the lookout for a good instant at a fair price.  I'd heard positive things about Cafe Bustelo Mexican Blend, so I decided to purchase the Amazon 4-pack and give it a try.  The box arrived in good shape with the bottles individually bubble-wrapped and protected. The bottle itself has a beautifully designed logo in appealing colors....Now for the taste test.  I did not hold the illusion that this coffee would rival drip, and it did not.  It was however, a good instant, more flavorful than most, and infinitely better than Folger's (one of the worst).  It reminded me of Taster's Choice, another good instant, but extremely over-priced.  Bottom line: This is a good instant at a fair price.  If you like instant coffee and don't expect ""as good as fresh-brewed"", you won't be disappointed.  Skip the Taster's Choice and give Cafe Bustelo Mexican Blend a try."

Price is high and 1 can lasts only 4 days.  Manufactured in England.  Comparable American made product called Elecare, just as good, slightly better price, but if you go to the Neocate manufacterer website and call their customer service you can request your first sample can free.  Good product for infants with milk protien allergies.  We were concerned about strange colored soiled diaper and pediatrician tested it and came up positive for blood in stool.  Doc started us on elemental formulas first.  Two are widely available.  Similac Alimentum and Enfamil Nutramigen.  Enfamil adds DHA to their formula in an attempt to make it more comparable to breast milk but our infant couldn't digest it and passed it as a thick yellow paste.  If you sign up at Similac website they will mail you samples of their other formulas but also several coupons for $5 off any of their formulas which really helped offset the cost.  Be prepared though.  All of these smell horrid and taste nasty as a powder, not as bad once mixed with water.  Fortunately infant tastebuds are not as developed. Baby still had a lot of reflux and gas even when we tried adding every colic remedy/gripe water on the market, which also drove up our feeding costs.  Pediatrician warned these rememdies are good for occassinal not chronic use.  So we stepped up to the Neocate.  After making my first purchase on Amazon, I got bolder and started poking around ebay.  Occasionally finding a better price but be sure to check shipping charges.  Some people make it look like they are selling it cheaper and jack up their shipping charges .  And there is all the drama, bidding wars and you can get sucked in just like in gambling so set your price point and stick to it.  A newer better offer is born daily. Sellers are not as reliable as Amazon and don't always package product well enough to prevent cans from denting.  And keep in mind, most infants will only need this product for the first 9 months to one year and then you can switch to soy or less expensive alternatives.  Good luck and good nights."

As the sweltering East Coast heat and humidity approaches, potassium helps with the fluid you lose. Whether you are on fluid pills, or working outside in the eat, or running and jogging for your health, or hiking, or your children are playing and running in the heat, it's a real good idea to keep those potassium levels up. Low potassium levels, as I understand it, can be harmful, leading to cramps in your legs or worse--maybe even making you pass out.

Really light flavor, refreshing, perfect bit of citrus.  I decided to try a different flavor, so I bought a 12-pack of the Peach & Mango.  The name sounded appealing - how can anyone mess up peach, I figured.  Let me say this - it is honestly one of the foulest things I've ever tasted.  I cannot articulate the taste because it's so uniquely bad - you will have to try it for yourself (which I don't recommend).  I was able to drink half of one container before pouring the rest out in disgust.  Reminds me of when I was a teenager and I was forcing down my first mixed alcoholic drink and the taste was nearly unbearable.  I had my friend try a container and his was awful, too.  I eventually threw out the remaining 9 cartons (note: I used a 3rd one to trick another friend into trying this repugnant crap as a gag).<br /><br />I don't know if I got a bad batch or if this is how Peach & Mango is supposed to taste but I am thoroughly dissatisfied.<br /><br />Update: it's been months since I wrote this review and I stand by it.  My friend bought a separate batch and the taste was identical.  Peach & Mango is the worst VitaCoco flavor, in my opinion.  Honestly, it's one of the worst beverages I've ever tasted - period - next to a can of unsweetened Oolong tea I purchased at Wegman's.

This bread is great and also makes a fantastic pizza crust, it doesn't have the strong aftertaste that some of the GF breads have.  I've never used a breadmaker, always make it by hand, I wear latex gloves to mix it so my hands don't get gluey, I follow the instructions exactly, and it has come out fine every time.  I preheat/warm the oven to 150 or so degrees for 5-10 mins before I start the dough, then shut off the oven.  Spray Pam in the bowl and on top of the dough, cover the bowl and dough with a wet towel, and let it rise in warmed oven.  After risen an hour I then wear gloves again, cover a pizza pan with E.V. flavored olive oil, and spread the dough as thin as possible in the pan because it will rise when baked.  If anyone would like to see what the final pizza looks like I have it posted on Facebook under Gluten free Professionals group.  I also freeze unused dough, take it out the night before, and it makes great bread, rolls, or pizza and the dough is even more workable when it's cold.  Been using Schar for years without a problem, I have a feeling the folks had trouble due to the breadmakers, I work the dough by hand with gloves and it only takes a few minutes.  Remember the ingredients need to be lukewarm for the yeast.  I also plan to make onion bread and maybe olive bread with the Schar mix.  I have also make a spinach pie roll with this dough, spread it out, layer sauted fresh spinach and pepperoni and provolone cheese, roll it up, and bake, it's great.  I have also made sauted Calzones, and fried dough (doughboys) which are fantastic with a bit of sugar, just saute in a bit of olive oil in a nonstick pan and the dough fluffs up great and they taste fantastic.

Schar products have me hooked! I made the white bread last night and it turned out better than any of the others we've tried and don't come across as too heavy on any one type of flour. I do not recommend using a bread machine for the mix. Why? It's a simple matter to throw the ingredients in a mixer and they don't require any fancy treatment. Pat the batter into a greased and floured loaf pan, stick it someplace warm with a wet towel over it and wait. That's probably the most important thing... It doesn't give a time on the box, it just says ""until doubled"". Give it time... Took over an hour for me, but it was a bit cooler in the house than it probably would have liked. Baked it for exactly the time mentioned on the box and placed the loaf pan on a cookie sheet filled with water. Loaf came out looking like it might be under-cooked, but it wasn't!

The bread gets a nice crust and pretty good flavor.<br /><br />When I make my bread, I'm more successful in the oven rather than the bread maker.  It's absolutely key that you put a pyrex of water in the rack under the bread pan when you bake this bread - otherwise you get a pretty tough and dry crust.  Be sure to put the pyrex in the oven when you preheat the oven. That way when the bread dough goes in, the oven is already humid.  Obviously you can't do that in the bread maker - so oven is the only way to go.<br /><br />I have also found that adding an extra 1/2 cup of water gives the bread a bit more volume.  I also add 2 tbls of honey - this is not much in terms of sweetness, but it does mellow out any unusual flavors that are always found in GF bread.<br /><br />If you're new to GF, this a great bread to try."
567247,B001FA1LF2,AWCDDYGC3DKD1,"Captious Consumer ""CC""",0,0,5,1295222400,A REALLY big hit with my non-gf household!,"Well, this was the first time I tried a bread maker.  I followed some advice here and ended up with the dough overflowing, but maybe I did something wrong...  Anyway, I managed to get the just-starting-to-cook dough out of the machine and into 2 bread pans (that dough had REALLY risen!)and cooked them separately somewhat according to the directions on the box (since it was already partially cooked, and had an extra cup of water in it - and I did not put a pan of water under it while baking in the oven)and they came out looking unusual (very white on top) but were incredibly tasty!!  I'll second that it tastes a lot like a french bread.  Kind of crispy and chewy crust, very moist and fluffy inside.  Nothing like gf bread at all.  No one could believe how good it was!  I really think this would make an excellent pizza dough since the crust is so crispy and chewy.  Of course, these were the results of having it flop in the bread machine first.  I hope I can duplicate my results while avoiding another disaster! EXCELLENT BREAD!  Now, if only they could keep it in stock...<br /><br />Edited to add:  I've now tried this with less water (about 2 and 1/2 cups) and the loaf came out perfect!  I have also had my machine prepare the dough and before it started the baking cycle I took it out, divided it into 4, flattened circles (like pizza crusts), filled it with meat, sauce and cheese, and then folded it over and pinched the edges and baked it at 425 for about a 1/2 hour to 35 mins.  Mmmm.... CALZONES!  Absolutely delicious, crisp crust and very tasty!<br /><br />The main problem with this product is that it does not brown.  It is always white on the outside.  And the longer you cook it, the more rock-hard it gets.  I missed crunchy dough though since going gf, so I don't mind it slightly over-cooked."

Believe me, it would have to be for me to make it!<br /><br />It's pretty good following the package directions, but what really made it fantastic was adding a full additional cup of water to the recipe, as recommended by one of the other reviewers. (This brings the total to 3 cups of water.)<br /><br />Following the package directions, you really need to eat this bread the day you bake it (so make sure you make it in the morning!). Fortunately, this has not been a problem at my house. Adding the extra cup of water, it was still edible the next day.<br /><br />I did put the bread in the oven to rise for 30 minutes, with the oven temperature set at ""warm"".<br /><br />-------------------<br /><br />Since writing the above, I purchased a bread machine. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067REBU"">Sunbeam 5891 2-Pound Programmable Breadmaker</a><br /><br />After 5 or 6 trial-and-error attempts, all moderately successful, I have cracked the code to making this bread mix work optimally in this machine. Here it is:<br /><br />Instead of putting the wet ingredients in first (as the machine's booklet instructs), put the DRY ingredients in first, then the wet ingredients. Use the settings:<br /><br />1 Basic<br />1 1/2 pound loaf<br />Dark crust<br /><br />While following the directions (of the machine) will work, following my directions leads to bread that rises half again as high. This yields a fluffier texture which, frankly, tastes less gluten-free. (You know what I'm talking about!) The individual slices of bread are then so huge that you can literally cut one in half and make a decent-size PBJ."

After 3 days sitting at room temperature, still good, but drying slightly (no crumbling) - after 3 more days in the refrigerator, tastes like a good chewy English muffin, toasted, and STILL no crumbling.  Just don't let the white-ish exterior fool you into baking it longer.

Since I have baked bread for many years, I decided to try some modifications to see if the end product could be improved.<br /><br />I mixed the dough using a stand mixer, rather than by hand in a bowl.  I added one TBS of sugar, and increased the water from two to nearly three cups.  Before putting the bread in the oven I brushed the top with melted butter.<br /><br />The result was a nicely browned loaf which had risen nicely. The texture and flavor was very satisfactory.

Sure enough three days later we received an e-mail thanking us along with a picture of the orchids, and they were right, the flowers were beautiful and you could see in the picture that only half of the buds had bloomed and that along with the other half, they would probably last an other week.

Unlike dehydrated apples, which are chewy, these chips are super thin and crispy.  But they get that crispiness because of the oil added when they make them.  Sure they have less fat than potato chips, but don't kid yourself that these are a low-fat snack.<br /><br />Still, these chips are a fantastic treat when you want something that crunches much like a potato chip, and they have much less fat and far more flavor than a potato chip.  But there's another trade off - you don't have the sodium of potato chips, but you do have extra sugar.<br /><br />I originally found these chips in my local coop at about twice the price I'm paying for them on Amazon, so I was thrilled to find them here.  Even at the high price, I occasionally bought a bag.  With the lower price, I can keep them on hand.<br /><br />All in all, despite the fact that these aren't the most nutritious snack out there and they're more expensive than an individual bag of potato chips, I keep them in my cupboard as I (and my family) love them.  There are supposedly 2.5 servings a bag, but I doubt many of us get that many servings out of a bag.  These chips are really tasty and satisfying - and once you open a bag, you'll likely keep eating until they're all gone.<br /><br />Why do I give these five stars despite the fat, sugar, and price?  They're one of the best light, crunchy treats I've found and they're incredibly tasty.  I love 'em!"

They put a caffeine meter on the box to compare this tea with cola and coffee beverages-this tea has 5 mg of caffeine compared to 90 in a cup of drip coffee. This tea is reported as having a high level of antioxidants-higher than green tea. The level of antioxidants and information about them would be a good addition. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface. Here is a poem they put on this box:<br /><br />""Ten thousand flowers in the spring, the moon in autumn, a cool breeze in summer, snow in winter.

567529,B003JO0VV2,AWG9MM2IQ4CQA,"Greg Johnson ""Thorgrym""",34,35,5,1292889600,Enjoying Wholesome Kefir,"Since I began following <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425204138"">The Maker's Diet</a> in order to improve my health, I have been interested in adding kefir as regular part of my daily nutrition.  Sadly, all of the kefir that I have been able to find is both low-fat and pasteurized.  As well, many varieties have undesirable additives (fructose, preservatives, etc.).  Recently, I have been reading more information about the benefits of kefir, so I began to look for a way to make my own.  I am already drinking raw milk from a local farm and have been making yogurt from that, so making kefir seemed like a good idea.  A health food store that I frequent sells kefir starter but it requires that the milk be heated first (according to the directions on the package) - essentially pasteurizing the milk and negating all of the benefits of raw milk in the process.  My search brought me to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a>.  At first, I was a little put off by the price.  When I learned that the kefir grains can be used indefinitely with proper care and feeding, I decided to place my order.<br /><br />When I received my package of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a>, I was a little concerned by the condition.  The box was shipped in a cardboard 'sleeve' that had been crushed.  The product box was considerably flatter than it should have been, but the small, sealed 'envelope' containing the dried kefir grains inside was unharmed.  My suggestion would be to revise the packaging or choose a better shipping carton to prevent/minimize any potential damage.  That said, the damage was purely cosmetic.<br /><br />When my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a> arrived, I immediately set to reading the included instructions.  While I was a little dismayed at having to wait a week (or more) for the grains to be revitalized (by putting them in fresh milk daily until they are ready), I was eager to start enjoying homemade kefir!  I wasn't entirely positive if the grains were fully ready after 7 days, so I gave it another 3 days.  Even though the instructions say to start with smaller quantities of milk (about 8 oz.) for the first batch of kefir and stepping up to the desired amount, I made my first batch out of a full quart.  It came out great!<br /><br />I am currently making my 4th batch.  To store the grains between batches, I simply put them in a jar with about 6 oz. of milk stored in the refrigerator for a couple of days until I am ready to make a new batch.<br /><br />If you are looking to enjoy the health benefits of homemade kefir, I recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JO0VV2"">Milk Kefir Grains</a> by Cultures for Health.  Be patient - it is worth the wait."

Who knew kefir could be made at home so easily?! The insert with the small package of minuscule ""grains"" is a bit intimidating and you may think there is some difficult process to be followed. But it's so easy. Just place the grains in a cup of milk and put it on a shelf in the kitchen. Pour out the milk (just not the grains) and pour in fresh milk every 24 hours. For the first 2-3 days as the grains start stretching out their legs, growing their muscles, pushing and shoving each other, the kefir may be watery or bitter at first. After a couple of days, you start to get sweet-tasting coagulated kefir every 24 hours or so. You will save and save so much you won't know what to do with your money."

It also had (& still has) their name on it as ""by Cultures of Health LLC"" but then further down is says ""Ships from and sold by Lifetime Kefir.""  I just want to clarify for everyone out there, who like me thought I was buying from a specific COMPANY that sells milk kefir, that this is not sold through Cultures for Health & it is not sponsored or affiliated with them in any way.  I contacted Cultures for Health today and the customer service lady said that they are not affiliated with this ""Lifetime Kefir"". I also received my kefir grains in a plastic baggie & wrapped in about 5 more plastic baggies, all smooshed up flat, and looking nothing like the cauliflower looking kefir grains you see pictures of.  Needless to say I was a little freaked out.  I decided to just try it out & see if the kefir grew and 'worked'.  -----  THAT BEING SAID ..... the kefir grew wonderfully! and has tripled or quadrupled in a months time.  I also sent the seller a question after working with and growing my kefir for about 2 or 3 days and he gave me a quick, polite, fairly thorough answer. Customer service seemed just good ... and quick.  I started with making about 1c of kefir and it was fizzy, clumpy/watery, weird.  I didn't know what I was supposed to be looking for but I guess this is normal and I just kept working with it each day changing the milk out and making new kefir.  It took about 1-2 weeks before it was producing well and I was making good kefir (not fizzy, but creamy now).  I was slowly figuring out how to work with the product.  I now make a quart jar of kefir daily.  I switch out the grains/kefir each morning and am left with about 3-4 cups of kefir each day.  All-in-all, I think the product is good. *****UPDATE 7/13/11******:  Since the initial review here, I have contacted the seller about some things & have had wonderful, very polite, and very quick customer service.  There is nothing bad to say at all about the customer service with this seller, in my opinion.  He seems to go out of the way to make sure the buyer is fully satisfied with the product.  And the product seems great.  My grains have grown tremendously and I have probably 1 to 1 1/2 CUPS of kefir GRAINS now.  That is all from about 1T of smooshy, yellow looking 'stuff' (kefir grains) that I initially got from the seller.  It took a couple weeks for them to start working ""normally"" and looking more ""normal"" but just give them some time and they seem to come through and make great kefir.  The only reason for less than 5 stars is simply because I feel like there still is a little misleading advertising in the product.  It appears this seller (Lifetime Kefir) has a few different kefir grain ads/products on amazon & the one that I bought from ([...]) shows that it is ""by: Cultures for Health, LLC"" and ""shipped and sold by Lifetime Kefir"".  I thought I was buying the grains from Culture for Health through a middle-man, so to speak.  When actually it is not a Cultures for Health product at all.  Maybe no big deal to others, but it was for me.  It ended up being a great product in the end though."

When re-hydrated there was a very tiny amount of actual grains. I put them in a jar with milk on a seedling mat to keep them the right temperature (our house is cool at night) and was very careful, and yet the milk kept curdling because there weren't enough grains, or just going yeasty. And they're growing very, very slowly. Two weeks later and I have a half teaspoon of grains. So far the milk has never smelled anything like kefir. In desperation I started adding some kefir powder and kefir, thinking that maybe they'd pick up some missing bacteria. Also, the instructions are misleading when they talk about it taking two weeks to ""rehydrate"". What you're doing is growing them to the point that you have enough to actually make kefir. I'm starting to think that dehydrated grains are a bad idea. But at the very least they ought to give you enough of them, instead of the tiny amount.<br /><br />Because it didn't seem like it was working very well, I ordered two tablespoons of live kefir grains from another vendor. They arrived yesterday, and I put them in milk. Today I think I have almost a quarter cup of grains.

I've previously made milk kefir from grains obtained through Marilyn ""Kefirlady"" and through the local leader of the Weston A. Price chapter. Both Kefirlady's and those obtained through Weston A. Price produced much better kefir. One of the main differences I could tell is that the kefir grains I've received from Cultures of Health do not create the ""slimy"" casing around the grains as I had experienced with other vendors. This leads me to believe that the grains are lacking some of the bacteria or yeasts that form the kefir grains. The taste is also not as sour as other previous grains. I understood that the first week or so of batches would not be up to par however I'm well past that.

They helped with our gut and regularity immensely.<br /><br />However, this is NOT a Cultures for Health company product. It is from 'Lifetime kefir."" I've never written a review before, and I do buy items very frequently online. I'm usually easy going with how things turn out through the mail. It arrived VERY warm and wet and in a PLASTIC bag. The dried kefir is much more shelf-stable through the mail and arrives in better packaging that doesn't leach chemicals into the product. Shipping was much slower than expected. It ended up shipping separately from my other items and arrived several days after the others. This is questionable whether it is safe to use because of the heat (it's summer here!) and plastic, and I certainly cannot give this to my small immune-compromised child of which is why I ordered this in the first place. For the customer service, I cannot yet say how they handled this issue, but I'm hoping for a full refund, shipping cost in all. I will update on the customer service aspect. Order directly from CFH. It's faster and better quality."

What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf.""<br /><br />Although this tea says ""orange pekoe"", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones.

They all seem to have good flavors, good ingredients, and they don't have as high of calories as some of the others do.<br /><br />Cinnamon Coffee Cake really did taste like a cinnamon coffee cake.  It was pleasantly sweet, with that hint of spice from the cinnamon, and there was a little bit of sweet frosting stuff drizzled on top too.  It definitely had the crunch as well from the different grains the bar was made up of.  And I liked the crunch, it really made it feel like you were biting into something substantial.<br /><br />The ingredients are good in this bar.  Not the best out of all the brands out there, but still reasonably decent.  The main sweetener is Brown Rice Syrup, but there is also crystalline fructose and evaporated can juice crystals.  The grains are the Kashi seven grain blend that they like to advertise and there's wheat bran and a few other things included as well.  There are some hard to pronounce ingredients, but these appear to be the vitamins.<br /><br />This bar has 160 calories in it.  Not as much as some but still not enough to justify eating these as a snack.  Use them for when you're exercising, or don't have enough time for a full breakfast.  There is 5 grams of fiber and 8 grams of protein as well.  Although there are 13 grams of sugar, which seems a little high.  I do have to say that eating one of these bars does not make me as full as other bars do.  I started getting hungry around ten am after eating the bar at 8 am.  But it still did ok in that aspect, and maybe I was just hungrier than usual.<br /><br />A great flavored bar, I'd definitely buy it again.  I can just see it being a good one to take on a bike trip or some other kind of event.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.  That is the name of the artificial sweetner, in the product.  If you like Splenda,you may like this.  But, it has a distinct taste. Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,""It wasn't bad."" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.<br />If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar. If your going to order I would get the small pack to try it.  Better then throwing out 30.  Try Cafe Escapes and Swiss Miss and see for yourself."

I got a single pack before and it was so good that I reordered some more. I like to make a mocha by brewing one of these and then one coffee (use a big cup).<br /><br />One thing to note: these dont have a strainer inside, the entire contents are meant to be used (unlike the coffee Kcups) so it will feel empty once done. I would not recommend brewing on the smaller cup settings. Use a standard mug or larger because the smaller settings wont get all the chocolate from the inside to come out.<br /><br />Also, kids may not like the peppermint flavor....

Put it in your machine, close the lid, open the lid, turn 90 degrees, close the lid and repeat two more times.  You should have closed the lid on the k-cup four times by now.  Next step is to hit the brew button.  The problem is the needle is too small to run the chocolate through.  With the extra three holes it all flows out very quick and turns out good.  Would have given them five stars if it was able to run through the needle like it is supposed to.  Could have been a little thicker overall, but not bad."

This has more body to it than others.<br />I'm still waiting and hoping that Dunkin' Donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k-cup.

567686,B005K4Q68Q,A1J75JJ0Q2OEJN,Raven A. Wind,187,216,3,1325808000,Why can't anyone make a hot cocoa without sucralose/Splenda in it?,"I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon."

Some complain that there is noting left in the pod after it has filled the cup, so 'therefore' it must have been an instant mix!  Brilliant deduction, Sherlock!  What did you expect...to see choco-grounds in the cup?  Yes, it is no doubt cheaper to go some other route, that's why 4 instead of 5 stars.<br /><br />But the taste is what you want to know about, right?  The Dark Chocolate flavor is fairly robust with little 'grittyness' to it.  Plop a marshmallow in the cup before brewing and you'll have a real treat!  It comes out strong enough on either the 6 oz or 10 oz setting of the brewer.  Not surprisingly, the milk chocolate flavor is not as strong and a little smoother.  Marshmallow trick has a little different effect making the milk chocolate not only creamier and smoother but a little dilute too.  So, maybe a few mini-marshmallows instead of a full-sized one for this flavor.  Oh, and definitely go 6 oz cup.  My oldest granddaughter and I contest for the peppermint chocolate.  She wins, of course, but it's pretty good when I can get one.  No marshmallow needed.  The hint of peppermint is just enough.  6 oz cup on this one is the best way to go, too.<br /><br />I think I got the cups sizes right.  If I didn't, you'll figure it out.  Btw, I'd imagine the reason it's always out of stock is because people keep buying it!  I've dipped into the supply well a few times myself.  Pretty good. Pretty cheap. Pretty hard to get at times.

I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste.

I just got them last week and have had a few cups since then.  I'm using 8 ounces of water to prepare the cocoa.  I thought they tasted pretty good - reasonably chocolaty and smooth.<br /><br />They were sweet, but not overly so, and the richness made me check the calorie count on the box.  60 calories - hey, not too bad!  It wasn't until now that I came back to place a review and I read the most recent reviews from others did I realize they use artificial sweetener.  Honestly, if I hadn't read it I would have never known - I didn't detect anything that gave me the hint when I drank it.<br /><br />I think if you like a quick cocoa on the run you'll be happy enough with these K-cups.  Are they as good as a Swiss Miss packet from Costco?  Maybe not, but in my office I don't want to deal with getting powder on the counters and needing a spoon to get things mixed.

I tried them on the different cup sizes, adding things, etc. There's just this strange taste to them that doesn't sit well on the tongue.

I'm going to give my second box to a friend, she doesn't seem to notice it. My daughter and husband both said it tasted weird, so it's not just me.

While the flavor is not super premium like a Godiva or Ghiradhelli, it is better than your average instant mix and much better than the other weak K Cup versions I've had.  The sucralose does give it an aftertaste that reminds me of the sweetness of a commercial cake mix, but it isn't unpleasant.<br /><br />I like to brew this on the smallest setting (4oz) and then add milk to fill the cup and warm it in the microwave, I think that gives a richer taste. The peppermint is my favorite, followed by the dark and then the light chocolate.  They are all very good.  My only wish is that I could buy the peppermint on its own and not in a combo pack only."

If you read all the reviews on every product you'll discover that nothing gets past everyone and maintains a perfectly spotless reputation.  So I decided that even with some bad reviews I'd try this one since it has a lot of good reviews.  I'm just going to say that there are some real hot chocolate connoisseurs writing reviews in this thread.  Some discerning reviewers say it has a slight taste of sugar substitute, or some such thing.  All I can tell you is I must have under-achieving taste buds because all I can taste is yummy hot chocolate.  My family burned through the first box and I just ordered two more.  If you don't like this I feel sorry for you. Better to have numb taste buds I guess.  Enjoy."

Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some."

I just think since he did not have any flavor like that before ( tomato, beef, spices ) he just need to get used to the flavor. Sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste. I will keep adding less of the veggie blends and I bet he will get used to the taste in no time. So do not give up if your baby doesn't like it right away. I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.<br />My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.<br /><br />UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.<br />Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.<br />So if you did not have luck first time do not give up, it took couple tries for us and now he loves it."

My son retched upon the first bite of the new meal.  Why do companies try to ""improve"" upon something that already works.  I'm guessing to cut corners somehow (ie. cheaper ingredients).  It's a shame.  I now have a case of the new recipe that won't be eaten."

She likes them a lot so i wanted to try something with meat. This product has good reviews so I ordered it thinking you can't go wrong with sweet potatoes and chicken. But i was wrong it taste bad.My daughter won't eat it even when she is starving. She actually didn't want to eat anything for few hours after she tried it first time. I even spiced it up a little bit hoping that she likes it but nope:(I don't blame her.I don't like it either.<br /><br />Update: Few months later I reintroduced my daughter this product and she seems to like it now. She ate it well for week when we were traveling. I ordered another one for our upcoming trip.

My daughter eats this companies products all the time.  Chick Chick is great, Beef Stew is wonderful, but Gobble Gobble is weird.  My daughter didn't mind the taste, but I could not get over the texture.  It looked like a giant blob of wet dog food.  It was more putty-like than any other flavor.  I actually had to cut bites off of it.  I am grossed out just thinking about it.  Good thing there are other flavors."

It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes break the glass jars of other brands. I will just need to remember to pack some sandwich baggies in case it not working out when trying to eat it on the go."

I don't know why people are saying that it is gross or bitter.  It tastes like ministrone (an italian tomato-based soup with pasta and veggies).  My 7 1/2 month old loves it.  He is a really good eater in general but actually makes little ""mmms"" when he eats this meal.  Definitely warm it up.  It is really yummy!  I like the suggestion to serve with Avacado.  We give him avacado almost every day and the creamy texture is a wonderful compliment to the tomato/acidic flavor of this meal."

It is really liquid-y.. impossible for an unskilled/careless self-feeder to have much left on the spoon by the time it gets to her mouth (may be okay for younger babies who aren't self-feeding yet though). Also it only has 1g of protein now - not sure why / if there is less salmon in it? Anyway, it's off the menu here, and I am disappointed to have lost a healthful, convenient option."

My little girl LOVED the old formula, and it had more protein and calories than this new version.

I only buy organic food for him and Chick Chick is one of his favorites.  I tasted it and it's a little bland for me but I'm also not a baby.  He loves it and as long as he does, I'll keep it stocked for him.  I love the Happy Baby/Happy Tot brand and the variety they offer.  I prefer jars for convenience but I just empty this into a jar to heat.  I did find that one of the pouches had a leak at a seam.  I'm glad that I saw it before I gave it to him.  Now I check them each thoroughly before I open them.  If I can squeeze food out of a seam, it gets pitched."

The second ingredient behind water was tomatoes and it was evident in the taste of the product.  It didn't seem to have even a trace taste of beef.  Because of the high tomato content, the stew was very acidic.  I was a bit disappointed by this product."

I really don't like trying to puree meat so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package and it actually tasted great and wasn't lumpy.  This was one of the only meat baby foods that when I tasted - I loved it!  I felt like I was giving my child a complete meal and it was organic!

I was a little surprised to see the reviews that said it is dry and tastes bad.  I wonder if those were bad packets.  The ones we've had have always been moist.  The food is a little bit bland, but it is not recommended to feed babies salt or spices, so it's about what I'd expect.  I like this better than the Chick Chick because it has a firmer texture.  To me, the Chick Chick is runny.  I normally spoon feed this to our baby, but if I don't mind cleaning up a mess I sometimes allow her to eat it with her hands.  We've never had any problems with gagging or choking.  When the packet is empty she's still looking for more.  I make most of my daughter's baby food and am very particular about what packaged foods I give to her.  I feel okay about this one because there are no weird preservatives and I can identify all of the ingredients."

My little one LOVES his pouches, but this is one he would not have.  After tasting it, I had to agree with him.  Maybe he does not like green peppers either.  If I recall correctly, the ingredients do not have yellow or red peppers as shown on the picture, but rather there are green peppers.  I was very disappointed as it looked good in the picture, it sounded nice & healthy, and my baby loves all their other products.  I'd suggest you try ONE pouch to see if you like it before you purchase several."

But you can't really see the chicken, and I guess it has been pureed really fine. My daughter loves it and can finish the whole pack under 5 minutes.

I also ""subscribe and save"".  I get 16 at a time.  The baby doesn't mine eating the same flavor each day for 16 days, but at the end of 16 days, he smells like cat food.  Most cats will run at the sound of a can opener, mine have learned to listened for the tearing of the pouch.  If you get this flavor and your baby hates it- you can always use it as cat food.  The texture of this particular product is pretty good for my now 10 month old.  I got a Sprout product with lentils in it and he spit the lentils out.  It is kind of hit and miss with the textures of these foods because their rating has no consistency.  That's my one- and constant- complaint."

I'd eat it myself, but it is way too thick.  I got a case of it, so I'm going make it work.  So- I put the too watery stage 2 spinach mango pear and stage 3 mama grain in the blender and voila! Perfect texture.  Easy enough fix, however- I buy premade baby food because I don't want to blend my own.  I did with my 1st baby, but this is my 4th, and the novelty of making baby food, and the time required to do it- is long gone.  Happy Baby would do well to be more consistent in their labeling.

It now is almost all carrots (something that my boys eat constantly) and quinoa.  No eggplant.  Only red peppers as one of the last ingredients.

I can even tell from the smell of the new version which doesn't smell like fish at all that there is very little salmon in it.

Yellow curry was recommended, and the coconut milk based Thai version was a treat with both seafood and chicken-something I've had occasion to order again and again.<br /><br />So when trying to re-create the taste sensations above, I was less than thrilled at the idea of grinding individual spices, purchasing a number of pricey ingredients with limited shelf life and narrow applications.<br /><br />I did some research and found that many Thai housewives rely on the time and labor savings of using high quality curry pastes as the basis for soups, curries and more. Mae Ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting.<br /><br />This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels, with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first I was eager to try. It has a shelf life of 2 years, and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator.<br /><br />The flavors of lemon grass, shallot, gingery galanga, kaffir lime peel, warm spices and red chili are very well balanced. This is the only Mae Ploy Curry paste without shrimp paste, making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish, fish or fowl.<br /><br />I like to snip off one corner of the clear packet, then squeeze out just the amount I need-anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 2 Tablespoons, depending on the recipe. This helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste.<br /><br />For Thai curry, I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth, then add 3/4 Cup more broth per person, plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken, plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety.<br /><br />Mae Ploy's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip, salad dressing, or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through, (about 15-20 minutes at 325).<br /><br />The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and I would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price, without tedious preparation."

It comes in a plastic tub with an inner sealed bag so it should stay fresh longer if it is not opened right away. The flavor was more multidimensional than some other curry pastes we have tried. The heat level was just about right for us (we like some heat but not enough to overpower other flavors - the tongue should tingle a bit but not go numb). We still start with some chopped onions and sometimes add more ginger paste but the yellow curry is pretty good right out of the tub. The recipe on the tub suggests 50 grams of paste. We checked with a scale and 1 tablespoon is roughly 25 g (so 2 tablespoons of paste). We like it with a bit less - one and a half tablespoons for the given recipe otherwise it was too hot.

I saw the good reviews on this curry paste and decided to try it. The recipe on the container was a bit confusing but I followed it as best I could and found it was pretty hard to mess up anyway. I don't like my curry too spicy so I did less of the paste and more of the coconut milk and an extra tsp of sugar. It came out amazing! I loved it and can't wait to make it again for dinner!

Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review.  I'm sure it'll come down eventually.<br /><br />I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now.  As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend.  Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill.  I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1.  The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor.  2.  I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.  It's bright, but not too bright.<br /><br />Does the K-cup version do it justice?  Yes.  Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup.  I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered.<br /><br />You know what?  Even at $59.99, this review would be 5 stars.  It's that good."

I have a special affinity to Pike Place in Seattle, and this coffee has a particular taste that brings me a sense of the place. It is robust with a flavor of  cocoa and toasted nuts. It is subtle with a smooth body. As an aside, Starbucks opened  their first store in the Pike Place Market in 1971.<br /><br />When I received my Keurig, I hoped to find Pike Place K-Cups, and that was one of my first purchases. The coffee has the exact flavor and is so delicious! It is so easy and convenient to order from Amazon.

Even brewing the 6oz size, it is a little weak - far weaker than what is normal for this blend as made in a Starbucks. Why they didn't simply make this a ""Bold"" k-cup with more coffee grounds in it I can't say; but it would help. But if you like the stronger style of coffee Starbucks is known for, you'll be a bit disappointed. I don't plan to buy this again.<br /><br />So again, not bad, but nothing special.

I was so elated when I found out that Starbucks was now going to be in Keurig form, let alone this flavor.  I normally can not stand coffee with cream and sugar.  I enjoy my coffees, black, no cream or sugar, and STRONG.  This one is the lone exception.  Starbucks claims this is a medium roast.  Take it with a grain of salt.  It has a fantastic aroma but a bitter taste, with also a bit of an aftertaste.  The first time I had this at a Starbucks, I wanted to throw this out.  To be honest, it was nasty, but with the price of a Starbucks coffee, at their coffee shop, I refused to give in.  I added (2) packets of sugar, along with some half & half, and ""Oh my God"", I was in heaven.  I should say, this is for an 8oz cup.  Not only is this so good, it's actually my favorite coffee.<br /><br />Now with the K-Cup version... to make the equivalent, I select an 8oz brew, use half & half to where it's a medium brown, and (2) packets of Splenda.  Splenda, in coffee tastes as good as sugar.  I'm diabetic.  This tastes as good as if it was from their coffee shop.<br />Since this can get expensive if your going to have more than (2) cups a day, I've decided to purchase this in 1lb bags and use the ""ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"", to make this more cost effective.<br /><br />The bottom line is I think if you, like me, don't like this coffee, by itself, try it with cream and sugar.  You'll be surprised at the difference in taste.<br /><br />By the way... why this says I'm in New Caledonia, I have no idea nor can I get it to change.  I'm from NJ."

I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' Keurig Model ...<br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances.<br />When I returned back in this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada!

Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />* Pike Place + Colombian + Folgers are the different varieties that I tried on the New Keurig machine.<br />  The Colombian was the Best of the lot.<br /><br />Read my comments, after each bullet item:<br /><br />  * Features fresh Starbucks coffee in an easy-to-brew single-cup (K-Cup) serving. - Not as good as the Tassimo, which is about<br />  2 Steps BELOW a StarBucks Coffee House. I often found the Keurig ""Brew"" to be a tad Watery, not Rich & Flavorful.<br /> * Brews in 1 minute or less, so you can grab a cup when you're in a rush. - BUT, you have to Turn the Unit ON FIRST,<br />  so that it will Warm Up first, before the Blue Light comes on, indicating that it is ready to start brewing.<br /> * Medium Roast Ground Coffee - They call it 'Medium', but I think it's more MILD!<br /> * Smooth & Balanced - Disagree, Balanced with What? Tea?<br /> * Rumor of a Sale Price of only 38 buckaroos at Sam's Club & Costco - I cannot confirm this rumor.<br /><br />* There is now a New Rumor that StarBucks is going to be offering their Consumer Coffee Machine in the fall!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!"

The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it.

The pouch is very easy to open just by tearing the top of the pouch which has a pre-made notch to initiate an easy opening. Once the pouch is open it is not resealable. The Salmon can be eaten directly out of the pouch or you can empty the contents to make a salad or other meal.

I also carry some when hiking, backpacking, or camping.<br /><br />The pouch is relatively strong and would not easily be punctured by an object. As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Salmon in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 70 calories with 20 calories from fat. Each serving contains 13 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product is skinless and boneless. This Salmon is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Salmon is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2 years from that date that I purchased the Salmon so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date.

These are the tastiest purchased grilled/roasted peppers that we have ever tasted and I think we are roasted pepper connoisseurs.  This company also does sell a roasted piquillo pepper which for our taste is not quite as tasty as the grilled.  Don't get me wrong, their roasted are also good, but the grilled are over the top.  I do ""roast"" my own and the way I do them we as well as anyone who has ever tasted them go crazy for them.  But again, if you need or would rather purchase cooked peppers the DeLallo Grilled Piquillo Pepper will not disappoint you.  I usually purchase them at the store, however, when I checked the price of them online there was quite a savings at Amazon for a case of 12.  The case arrived in good condition and the jars had an appropriate expiration date on them.  No matter where you get them they are a little pricey, but someone grew and cared for these peppers, grilled, jared, labeled and shipped them.  Allot went into these little jars.  Whenever you see red peppers know that whoever grew them took care of them much longer to get them to the red stage rather than picking green.  I make my own salad dressings and I do add the liquid from the jar to my dressing.  The liquid is  flavored with the natural oil from the peppers and is delicious.  Try them!  You'll like them!"

Heim,0,0,5,1306454400,Tasty piquillos,"After Trader Joe's discontinued their piquillos I found Delallo peppers at Amazon, ordered them, and have been enjoying them ever since.  Their appearance, flavor, and country of origin (Peru) is the same as TJ's brand, though the Delallo product may be a little more flavorful.<br /><br />I was puzzled by the one negative review, which is a verbatim repeat of a critical review submitted a month earlier by the same writer for a different product -- the ""roasted"" piquillos.  I wonder if the alleged ""mold"" was actually char marks from the grill, which is normal?<br /><br />Anyway I received the 12-pack in good condition several days after ordering them, and am pleased with the quality of the product and the prompt, careful packing &  shipping (no breakage)."

The day after I placed the order, I received an email from Sweet Mona's stating that they had looked up the temperature in Texas and they would be packing the chocolate accordingly.

I have not tried the bulk product.<br /><br />This is a great alternative sweetener. It leaves no after taste that I can detect. I use it in tea, on cereal and in three different kinds of oatmeal. Everything that I have used it in or on has tasted the same as it did when sugar was used.<br /><br />I cam accross a couple of articles on Stevia while browsing on the Internet. After reading those two articles I did a little more research and decided to try Stevia. I found this product at our local Kroger store where it happened to be on sale. Kroger carries two ro three other Stevia based products however after comparing the list of ingredients for each I decided to buy the Stevia In The Raw. The list of ingredients for the packet form of this product is dextrose and Stevia Extract (Rebiana).<br /><br />OK, I tired it and it tastes great in everyhting I have used it with but I was curious. The Stevia extract is supposed to be 200 to 400 times more intensely sweet than sugar. If that is the case why was dextrose used and why was it the more prevalent ingredient? I called the company on their 800 and asked this same question. The answer is (according to them) that dextrose is a carbohydrate derived from crushed corn. It is a filler in their product. The Rebiana is so intensely sweet that it was impractical to package it in its pure form in individual packets. The volume would be so small that consumers would wonder if anything was really there. To me this sounds plausible. I am not a dietician, a doctor nor do I work for the company. I simply use their product and like it.<br /><br />I hope this info is helpful. Everyone have a gret day out there."
568250,B00374ZKQ0,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,Chandler,38,45,1,1320192000,You'll need 3 packs to equal one pack of Truvia. Not a bargain.,"First of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.<br /><br />While I personally do not believe the phrase ""You get what you pay for"" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.<br /><br />I do like sugar in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).<br /><br />But, first of all, this isn't ""in the raw"". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose. Dextrose is a very cheap additive that's sweet that's made from corn. It's high carb. Great if you just finished a tough workout and need carbs. Not great if you call yourself Stevia in the RAW<br /><br />Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled ""raw"" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it.  Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself ""raw"" either.<br /><br />But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?<br /><br />Huh-uh.<br /><br />You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.<br />You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.<br /><br />Superb huh?<br /><br />Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think ""Woo Hoo! I get more for less!"" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.<br /><br />Not so fast.<br /><br />I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter.  I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.<br /><br />So that got me thinking...<br /><br />I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.<br />It is 1.75 ounces.<br />I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!<br /><br />WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.<br /><br />And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.<br /><br />But, wait...one more thing...<br /><br />Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too.  Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...<br /><br />It wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />Truvia, by the way, has Erythritol in it. This is one of the best all-natural zero calorie sweeteners you can buy. The Brand Z Sweet is erythritol. It's great for diabetics and dieters because it's the one that will NOT spike your blood sugar but is still all-natural. Stevia is so lightweight it needs a counterpart. Erythritol is a stevia cousin. Dextrose is a cheap filler that isn't."
568251,B00374ZKQ0,A1I1V7QUWSMYGA,Your Online Bookstore,13,15,5,1265760000,This is the only brand out there with minimal aftertaste,"I'm not 100% certain this is the same product sold at [...], but this is the only place I could find to review it, and I wanted to review it somewhere.  I love this stuff.  I've tried all the major stevia brands (including everything at Whole Foods), and Stevia in the Raw (which Whole Foods doesn't carry, sadly) is the only brand that doesn't taste like crap.  All other brands have a heavy bitter-licorice aftertaste.  Stevia in the Raw is unique in that I can put the powder itself to my tongue without grimacing.  I can't even do that with ""normal"" (i.e. toxic) sweeteners like NutraSweet or Equal (though Splenda tastes fine raw.)  I suppose I have a somewhat sensitive palate, and with the heavy amounts of sweetener I use, I can still detect a slight aftertaste even with Stevia in the Raw -- so if you're a heavy user with a sensitive palate, then just combine it with some erythritol and you're good to go.  No aftertaste whatsoever with that combo.  And this is way better for you than any other (palatable) sweetener."

NO FUNKY AFTERTASTE!!!,"I've tried for years and years to like stevia, but it's always left a funky aftertaste in my mouth that just ruined it's use for me. Until now, the most tolerable of the stevias was the vanilla cream by sweetleaf, but even that left the funky after taste.<br /><br />A few months ago I decided to go on a marathon stevia taste test adventure and bought almost every brand out there to give them each a go. I didn't have high expectations as I fully expected them all to leave me with the funky taste. I did not do truvia, because it has another added sweetener - it is not pure stevia. I only tested those that were pure stevia plain flavor and vanilla flavor (since the sweetleaf vanilla had been the best one so far).<br /><br />I was shocked beyond belief when using the stevia in the raw and not having any funky after taste! I tried it many different ways - in chai tea, to sweeten hot breakfast cereal, for baking and cooking sweet treats, etc. and no aftertaste! I also tried larger quantities, as sometimes the more you use the increased after taste. So far no matter what I've done with this stevia I've had NO aftertaste what-so-ever!!!<br /><br />If you've tried to like stevia and just can't get past the after taste then give stevia in the raw a go - I think you'll be very surprised and pleased as I've been. Yay - finally a stevia I like."

I compared it to other sweetners such as truvia and purvia, I like this product because I won't support coca cola(maker of truvia) or pepsi (maker of purvia) if i buy this.  Also, there is only two ingredients : dextrose and stevia extract.  Each pack is 1 gram, so I assume there is maybe 0.9 gram of which is dextrose, which IS a sugar, but the FDA allows the labeling to be such that if a serving is under 4 calories, it can be called 'zero-calories'.<br /><br />To my understanding, dextrose is needed as the bulking agent (probably stevia extract is so potent, no one can use it if its in pure form) Online searching have shown dextrose contains 3.7 cal per gram, so if you have to use many packets for your tea or coffee, it won't be calories-free.  BUT, 3 packets of this (maybe like 10 cal) made my 12 oz of water with lemon juice taste like a real cup of lemonade made with real sugar, and THAT would be like 110 calories. And it taste so much better and healthier than splenda."

My advice is that unless you physically cannot handle sugar, a small amount of raw sugar is much better for you than all this artificial crap. Just be smart about the stevia bandwagon everyone is jumping on, because pretty much every brand out there is just some other sweetener mixed with stevia and then sold as 'healthy'."

I didn't really care for the oats & chocolate, but I like the oats & peanut butter a lot.  It tastes very good with a nice mellow peanut butter flavor.  Even my young boys (6 and 3) like it.  As good as oats & peanut butter is, though, the caramel is 10 times better.  It tastes like a candy bar. Obviously, it has a firm texture, but it's not dry by any stretch.  It makes a great breakfast or part of a breakfast that can stick with you for a few hours.  It can also serve as a very satisfying snack.  I will confess that, since my supply of these bars has been limited, I haven't had my kids try them yet.  But, now that I have been finally able to order these from Amazon, I will definitely let them try this new flavor."
568305,B0013Z0PTW,A1HHEMY96W1M1V,Autodidact,3,3,3,1305244800,Inulin -- take it slowly!,"Inulin, found in chicory root, is the key ingredient here; everything else in the bar is designed to make it possible for you to eat the inulin.  Search the web on inulin (not insulin!) -- it is being touted as a wonderful probiotic ingredient.  And there's no question that eating these bars will make the trains run on time, so to speak.<br /><br />The problem is that not everyone tolerates inulin well, and tolerance is at different doses.  Some people experience gas, cramps, frequent bowel movements with tarry stool, and other kinds of GI distress.  This is not because of the increase in fiber per se -- it is a reaction to the specific fiber here, inulin.<br /><br />The bars are very sweet but don't treat them like a snack until you know how your body reacts.  (I read with horror the account of one person who sat down with a box and polished off four or five in a sitting.) Take it very very slowly.  I can tolerate one (1) bite of a bar a day; more than that and I get in trouble, period.  At one bite a day, this case of bars is lasting me a long, long time.  On the other hand, I'm not worried about the calories in the bar at that rate either.<br /><br />If you don't finish a bar you need to keep it in a baggie or container because it will dry out and become substantially less appealing.  Taste is fine, but I wish I had gotten the chocolate so that I could get my choco fix on at the same time."

If you don't have many of the aforementioned foods in your daily diet, then one or two of these a day may be a good fiber supplement. However, this comes at the cost of making you extremely gassy all through the day, which can be embarrassing and sometimes even annoying when it's more frequent than the occasional toot that slips out. IMHO, it's better to get the daily dietary fiber your body needs via the more natural means that I mentioned above.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind, especially when dieting, is that these bars are pretty high in sugar. (As much as 10g added sugar per bar!) Considering a ""healthy"" amount of added sugar per day maxes out at about 40-50g per day, eating a few of these bars will chew right through that cap in no time. There's also emerging research showing that eating high-sugar foods (like fiber one bars) will make you crave more sweets, leading you to eat or drink even more unhealthy things like candy bars and sodas. So if you're on a diet, eating these bars probably aren't as great for your diet as you think!<br /><br />I've been fiber one free for two weeks now and I'm happy for the decision.

And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.  But you do have to use around the same amount as regular sugar, maybe sometimes less, sometimes more.  Various mfgs. of the product claim you can use less.

You really need to use loose tea and cook it according to the directions.  I use half and half for the milk, and it makes a rich, spicy tea.  Additionally, for the sweetener, I use maple syrup instead of honey or sugar.  It might sound odd, but the maple syrup blends with the chai spices much better.
